<h2>CERES&rsquo; RUNAWAY</h2>
<p>One can hardly be dull possessing the pleasant imaginary picture
of a Municipality hot in chase of a wild crop&mdash;at least while the
charming quarry escapes, as it does in Rome.&nbsp; The Municipality
does not exist that would be nimble enough to overtake the Roman growth
of green in the high places of the city.&nbsp; It is true that there
have been the famous captures&mdash;those in the Colosseum, and in the
Baths of Caracalla; moreover a less conspicuous running to earth takes
place on the Appian Way, in some miles of the solitude of the Campagna,
where men are employed in weeding the roadside.&nbsp; They slowly uproot
the grass and lay it on the ancient stones&mdash;rows of little corpses&mdash;for
sweeping up, as at Upper Tooting; one wonders why.&nbsp; The governors
of the city will not succeed in making the Via Appia look busy, or its
stripped stones suggestive of a thriving commerce.&nbsp; Again, at the
cemetery within the now torn and shattered Aurelian wall by the Porta
San Paolo, they are often mowing of buttercups.&nbsp; &ldquo;A light
of laughing flowers along the grass is spread,&rdquo; says Shelley,
whose child lies between Keats and the pyramid.&nbsp; But a couple of
active scythes are kept at work there summer and spring&mdash;not that
the grass is long, for it is much overtopped by the bee-orchis, but
because flowers are not to laugh within reach of the civic vigilance.</p>
<p>Yet, except that it is overtaken and put to death in these accessible
places, the wild summer growth of Rome has a prevailing success and
victory.&nbsp; It breaks all bounds, flies to the summits, lodges in
the sun, swings in the wind, takes wing to find the remotest ledges,
and blooms aloft.&nbsp; It makes light of the sixteenth century, of
the seventeenth, and of the eighteenth.&nbsp; As the historic ages grow
cold it banters them alike.&nbsp; The flagrant flourishing statue, the
haughty fa&ccedil;ade, the broken pediment (and Rome is chiefly the
city of the broken pediment) are the opportunities of this vagrant garden
in the air.&nbsp; One certain church, that is full of attitude, can
hardly be aware that a crimson snapdragon of great stature and many
stalks and blossoms is standing on its furthest summit tiptoe against
its sky.&nbsp; The cornice of another church in the fair middle of Rome
lifts out of the shadows of the streets a row of accidental marigolds.&nbsp;
Impartial to the antique, the mediaeval, the Renaissance early and late,
the newer modern, this wild summer finds its account in travertine and
tufa, reticulated work, brick, stucco and stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bird
of the air carries the matter,&rdquo; or the last sea-wind, sombre and
soft, or the latest tramontana, gold and blue, has lodged in a little
fertile dust the wild grass, wild wheat, wild oats!</p>
<p>If Venus had her runaway, after whom the Elizabethans raised hue
and cry, this is Ceres&rsquo;.&nbsp; The municipal authorities, hot-foot,
cannot catch it.&nbsp; And, worse than all, if they pause, dismayed,
to mark the flight of the agile fugitive safe on the arc of a flying
buttress, or taking the place of the fallen mosaics and coloured tiles
of a twelfth-century tower, and in any case inaccessible, the grass
grows under their discomfited feet.&nbsp; It actually casts a flush
of green over their city <i>piazza</i>&mdash;the wide light-grey pavements
so vast that to keep them weeded would need an army of workers.&nbsp;
That army has not been employed; and grass grows in a small way, but
still beautifully, in the wide space around which the tramway circles.&nbsp;
Perhaps a hatred of its delightful presence is what chiefly prompts
the civic government in Rome to the effort to turn the <i>piazza</i>
into a square.&nbsp; The shrub is to take the place not so much of the
pavement as of the importunate grass.&nbsp; For it is hard to be beaten&mdash;and
the weed does so prevail, is so small, and so dominant!&nbsp; The sun
takes its part, and one might almost imagine a sensitive Municipality
in tears, to see grass running, overhead and underfoot, through the
&ldquo;third&rdquo; (which is in truth the fourth) Rome.</p>
<p>When I say grass I use the word widely.&nbsp; Italian grass is not
turf; it is full of things, and they are chiefly aromatic.&nbsp; No
richer scents throng each other, close and warm, than these from a little
hand-space of the grass one rests on, within the walls or on the plain,
or in the Sabine or the Alban hills.&nbsp; Moreover, under the name
I will take leave to include lettuce as it grows with a most welcome
surprise on certain ledges of the Vatican.&nbsp; That great and beautiful
palace is piled, at various angles, as it were house upon house, here
magnificent, here careless, but with nothing pretentious and nothing
furtive.&nbsp; And outside one lateral window on a ledge to the sun,
prospers this little garden of random salad.&nbsp; Buckingham Palace
has nothing whatever of the Vatican dignity, but one cannot well think
of little cheerful cabbages sunning themselves on any parapet it may
have round a corner.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Italy the vegetables&mdash;the table ones&mdash;have
a wildness, a suggestion of the grass, from lands at liberty for all
the tilling.&nbsp; Wildish peas, wilder asparagus&mdash;the field asparagus
which seems to have disappeared from England, but of which Herrick boasts
in his manifestations of frugality&mdash;and strawberries much less
than half-way from the small and darkling ones of the woods to the pale
and corpulent of the gardens, and with nothing of the wild fragrance
lost&mdash;these are all Italian things of savage savour and simplicity.&nbsp;
The most cultivated of all countries, the Italy of tillage, is yet not
a garden, but something better, as her city is yet not a town but something
better, and her wilderness something better than a desert.&nbsp; In
all the three there is a trace of the little flying heels of the runaway.</p>
<h2>A VANQUISHED MAN</h2>
<p>Haydon died by his own act in 1846, and it was not, in the event,
until 1853 that his journal was edited, not by Elizabeth Barrett Browning,
as he wished, but by Tom Taylor.&nbsp; Turning over these familiar and
famous volumes, often read, I wonder once more how any editor was bold
to &ldquo;take upon himself the mystery of things&rdquo; in the case
of Haydon, and to assign to that venial moral fault or this the ill-fortune
and defeat that beset him, with hardly a pause for the renewal of the
resistance of his admirable courage.</p>
<p>That he made a mere intellectual mistake, gave thanks with a lowly
and lofty heart for a genius denied him, that he prepared himself to
answer to Heaven and earth for the gift he had not, to suffer its reproach,
to bear its burden, and that he looked for its reward, is all his history.&nbsp;
There was no fault of the intellect in his apprehension of the thing
he thought to stand possessed of.&nbsp; He conceived it aright, and
he was just in his rebuke of a world so dull and trivial before the
art for which he died.&nbsp; He esteemed it aright, except when he deemed
it his.</p>
<p>His editor, thinking himself to be summoned to justify the chastisement,
the destruction, the whole retribution of such a career, looks here
and there for the sins of Haydon; the search is rewarded with the discovery
of faults such as every man and woman entrusts to the common generosity,
the general consciousness.&nbsp; It is a pity to see any man conning
such offences by heart, and setting them clear in an editorial judgement
because he thinks himself to hold a trust, by virtue of his biographical
office, to explain the sufferings and the failure of a conquered man.</p>
<p>What, in the end, are the sins which are to lead the reader, sad
but satisfied, to conclude with &ldquo;See the result of&mdash;&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;So it ever must be with him who yields to&mdash;,&rdquo; or
whatever else may be the manner of ratifying the sentence on the condemned
and dead?&nbsp; Haydon, we hear, omitted to ask advice, or, if he asked
it, did not shape his course thereby unless it pleased him.&nbsp; Haydon
was self-willed; he had a wild vanity, and he hoped he could persuade
all the powers that include the powers of man to prosper the work of
which he himself was sure.&nbsp; He did not wait upon the judgement
of the world, but thought to compel it.</p>
<p>Should he, then, have waited upon the judgement of such a world?&nbsp;
He was foremost in the task of instructing, nay, of compelling it when
there was a question of the value of the Elgin Marbles, and when the
possession&mdash;which was the preservation&mdash;of these was at stake.&nbsp;
There he was not wrong; his judgement, that dealt him, in his own cause,
the first, the fatal, the final injury&mdash;the initial subtle blow
that sent him on his career so wronged, so cleft through and through,
that the mere course and action of life must ruin him&mdash;this judgement,
in art, directed him in the decision of the most momentous of all public
questions.&nbsp; Haydon admired, wrote, protested, declaimed, and fought;
and in great part, it seems, we owe our perpetual instruction by those
judges of the Arts which are the fragments of the Elgin sculptures,
to the fact that Haydon trusted himself with the trust that worked his
own destruction.&nbsp; Into the presence especially of those seated
figures, commonly called the Fates, we habitually bring our arts for
sentence.&nbsp; He lent an effectual hand to the setting-up of that
Tribunal of headless stones.</p>
<p>The thing we should lament is rather that the world which refused,
neglected, forgot him&mdash;and by chance-medley was right, was right!&mdash;had
no possible authority for anything that it did against him, and that
he might have sent it to school, for all his defect of genius; moreover,
that he was mortally wounded in the last of his forty years of battle
by this ironic wound: among the bad painters chosen to adorn the Houses
of Parliament with fresco, he was not one.&nbsp; This affront he took
at the hands of men who had no real distinctions in their gift.&nbsp;
He might well have had, by mere chance, some great companion with whom
to share that rejection.&nbsp; The unfortunate man had no such fortuitous
fellowship at hand.&nbsp; How strange, the solitude of the bad painter
outcast by the worst, and capable of making common cause indomitably
with the good, had there been any such to take heart from his high courage!</p>
<p>There was none.&nbsp; There were ranged the unjust judges with their
blunders all in good order, and their ignorance new dressed, and there
was no artist to destroy except only this one, somewhat better than
their favoured, their appointed painters in fresco; one uncompanioned,
and a man besides through whose heart the public reproach was able to
cut keenly.</p>
<p>Is this sensibility to be made a reproach to Haydon?&nbsp; It has
always seemed to me that he was not without greatness&mdash;yet he was
always without dignity&mdash;in those most cruel passages of his life,
such as that of his defeat, towards the close of his war, by the show
of a dwarf, to which all London thronged, led by Royal example, while
the exhibition of his picture was deserted.&nbsp; He was not betrayed
by anger at this end of hopes and labours in which all that a man lives
for had been pledged.&nbsp; Nay, he succeeded in bearing what a more
inward man would have taken more hardly.&nbsp; He was able to say in
his loud voice, in reproach to the world, what another would have barred
within: one of his great pictures was in a cellar, another in an attic,
another at the pawnbroker&rsquo;s, another in a grocer&rsquo;s shop,
another unfinished in his studio; the bills for frames and colours and
the rent were unpaid.&nbsp; Some solace he even found in stating a few
of these facts, in French, to a French official or diplomatic visitor
to London, interested in the condition of the arts.&nbsp; Well, who
shall live without support?&nbsp; A man finds it where he can.</p>
<p>After these offences of self-will and vanity Tom Taylor finds us
some other little thing&mdash;I think it is inaccuracy.&nbsp; Poor Haydon
says in one phrase that he paid all his friends on such a day, and in
another soon following that the money given or lent to him had been
insufficient to pay them completely; and assuredly there are many revisions,
after-thoughts, or other accidents to account for such a slip.&nbsp;
His editor says the discrepancy is &ldquo;characteristic,&rdquo; but
I protest I cannot find another like it among those melancholy pages.&nbsp;
If something graver could but be sifted out from all these journals
and letters of frank confession, by the explainer!&nbsp; Here, then,
is the last and least: Haydon was servile in his address to &ldquo;men
of rank.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his servility seems to be very much in the
fashion of his day&mdash;nothing grosser; and the men who set the fashion
had not to shape their style to Haydon&rsquo;s perpetual purpose, which
was to ask for commissions or for money.</p>
<p>Not the forsaken man only but also the fallen city evokes this exercise
of historical morality, until a man in flourishing London is not afraid
to assign the causes of the decay of Venice; and there is not a watering
place upon our coasts but is securely aware of merited misfortune on
the Adriatic.</p>
<p>Haydon was grateful, and he helped men in trouble; he had pupils,
and never a shilling in pay for teaching them.&nbsp; He painted a good
thing&mdash;the head of his Lazarus.&nbsp; He had no fault of theory:
what fault of theory can a man commit who stands, as he did, by &ldquo;Nature
and the Greeks&rdquo;?&nbsp; In theory he soon outgrew the Italians
then most admired; he had an honest mind.</p>
<p>But nothing was able to gain for him the pardon that is never to
be gained, the impossible pardon&mdash;pardon for that first and last
mistake&mdash;the mistake as to his own powers.&nbsp; If to pardon means
to dispense from consequence, how should this be pardoned?&nbsp; Art
would cease to be itself, by such an amnesty.</p>
<h2>A NORTHERN FANCY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Dryden, writing to Dennis, &ldquo;I
remember poor Nat Lee, who was then upon the verge of madness, yet made
a sober and witty answer to a bad poet who told him, &lsquo;It was an
easy thing to write like a madman.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis a very difficult thing to write like a madman,
but &rsquo;tis a very easy thing to write like a fool.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the difficult song of distraction is to be heard, a light
high note, in English poetry throughout two centuries at least, and
one English poet lately set that untethered lyric, the mad maid&rsquo;s
song, flying again.</p>
<p>A revolt against the oppression of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries&mdash;the age of the re-discovery of death; against the crime
of tragedies; against the tyranny of Italian example that had made the
poets walk in one way of love, scorn, constancy, inconstancy&mdash;may
have caused this trolling of unconsciousness, this tune of innocence,
and this carol of liberty, to be held so dear.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard
a maid in Bedlam,&rdquo; runs the old song.&nbsp; High and low the poets
tried for that note, and the singer was nearly always to be a maid and
crazed for love.&nbsp; Except for the temporary insanity so indifferently
worn by the soprano of the now deceased kind of Italian opera, and except
that a recent French story plays with the flitting figure of a village
girl robbed of her wits by woe (and this, too, is a Russian villager,
and the Southern author may have found his story on the spot, as he
seems to aver) I have not met elsewhere than in England this solitary
and detached poetry of the treble note astray.</p>
<p>At least, it is principally a northern fancy.&nbsp; Would the steadfast
Cordelia, if she had not died, have lifted the low voice to that high
note, so delicately untuned?&nbsp; She who would not be prodigal of
words might yet, indeed, have sung in the cage, and told old tales,
and laughed at gilded butterflies of the court of crimes, and lived
so long in the strange health of an emancipated brain as to wear out</p>
<blockquote><p>Packs and sects of great ones<br />
That ebb and flow by the moon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She, if King Lear had had his last desire, might have sung the merry
and strange tune of Bedlam, like the slighter Ophelia and the maid called
Barbara.</p>
<p>It was surely the name of the maid who died singing, as Desdemona
remembers, that lingered in the ear of Wordsworth.&nbsp; Of all the
songs of the distracted, written in the sanity of high imagination,
there is nothing more passionate than that beginning &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
said that some have died for love.&rdquo;&nbsp; To one who has always
recognized the greatness of this poem and who possibly had known and
forgotten how much Ruskin prized it, it was a pleasure to find the judgement
afresh in <i>Modern</i> <i>Painters</i>, where this grave lyric is cited
for an example of great imagination.&nbsp; It is the mourning and restless
song of the lover (&ldquo;the pretty Barbara died&rdquo;) who has not
yet broken free from memory into the alien world of the insane.</p>
<p>Barbara&rsquo;s lover dwelt in the scene of his love, as Dryden&rsquo;s
Adam entreats the expelling angel that he might do, protesting that
he could endure to lose &ldquo;the bliss, but not the place.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(And although this dramatic &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; of Dryden&rsquo;s
is hardly named by critics except to be scorned, this is assuredly a
fine and imaginative thought.)&nbsp; It is nevertheless as a wanderer
that the crazed creature visits the fancy of English poets with such
a wild recurrence.&nbsp; The Englishman of the far past, barred by climate,
bad roads, ill-lighted winters, and the intricate life and customs of
the little town, must have been generally a home-keeper.&nbsp; No adventure,
no setting forth, and small liberty, for him.&nbsp; But Tom-a-Bedlam,
the wild man in patches or in ribbons, with his wallet and his horn
for alms of food or drink, came and went as fitfully as the storm, free
to suffer all the cold&mdash;an unsheltered creature; and the chill
fancy of the villager followed him out to the heath on a journey that
had no law.&nbsp; Was it he in person, or a poet for him, that made
the swinging song: &ldquo;From the hag and the hungry goblin&rdquo;?&nbsp;
If a poet, it was one who wrote like a madman and not like a fool.</p>
<p>Not a town, not a village, not a solitary cottage during the English
Middle Ages was unvisited by him who frightened the children; they had
a name for him as for the wild birds&mdash;Robin Redbreast, Dicky Swallow,
Philip Sparrow, Tom Tit, Tom-a-Bedlam.&nbsp; And after him came the
&ldquo;Abram men,&rdquo; who were sane parodies of the crazed, and went
to the fairs and wakes in motley.&nbsp; Evelyn says of a fop: &ldquo;All
his body was dressed like a maypole, or a Tom-a-Bedlam&rsquo;s cap.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But after the Civil Wars they vanished, and no man knew how.&nbsp; In
time old men remembered them only to remember that they had not seen
any such companies or solitary wanderers of late years.</p>
<p>The mad maid of the poets is a vagrant too, when she is free, and
not singing within Bedlam early in the morning, &ldquo;in the spring.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Wordsworth, who dealt with the legendary fancy in his &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo;
makes the crazed one a wanderer in the hills whom a traveller might
see by chance, rare as an Oread, and nearly as wild as Echo herself:-</p>
<blockquote><p>I too have passed her in the hills<br />
Setting her little water-mills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His heart misgives him to think of the rheumatism that must befall
in such a way of living; and his grave sense of civilization, <i>bourgeois</i>
in the humane and noble way that is his own, restores her after death
to the company of man, to the &ldquo;holy bell,&rdquo; which Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Duke remembered in banishment, and to the congregation and their &ldquo;Christian
psalm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older poets were less responsible, less serious and more sad,
than Wordsworth, when they in turn were touched by the fancy of the
maid crazed by love.&nbsp; They left her to her light immortality; and
she might be drenched in dews; they would not desire to reconcile nor
bury her.&nbsp; She might have her hair torn by the bramble, but her
heart was light after trouble.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many light hearts and wings&rdquo;&mdash;she
had at least the bird&rsquo;s heart, and the poet lent to her voice
the wings of his verses.</p>
<p>There is nothing in our poetry less modern than she.&nbsp; The vagrant
woman of later feeling was rather the sane creature of Ebenezer Elliott&rsquo;s
fine lines in &ldquo;The Excursion&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bone-weary, many-childed, trouble-tried!<br />
Wife of my bosom, wedded to my soul!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trouble did not &ldquo;try&rdquo; the Elizabethan wild one, it undid
her.&nbsp; She had no child, or if there had ever been a child of hers,
she had long forgotten how it died.&nbsp; She hailed the wayfarer, who
was more weary than she, with a song; she haunted the cheerful dawn;
her &ldquo;good-morrow&rdquo; rings from Herrick&rsquo;s poem, fresh
as cock-crow.&nbsp; She knows that her love is dead, and her perplexity
has regard rather to the many kinds of flowers than to the old story
of his death; they distract her in the splendid meadows.</p>
<p>All the tragic world paused to hear that lightest of songs, as the
tragedy of Hamlet pauses for the fitful voice of Ophelia.&nbsp; Strange
was the charm of this perpetual alien, and unknown to us now.&nbsp;
The world has become once again as it was in the mad maid&rsquo;s heyday,
less serious and more sad than Wordsworth; but it has not recovered,
and perhaps will never recover, that sweetness.&nbsp; Blake&rsquo;s
was a more starry madness.&nbsp; Crabbe, writing of village sorrows,
thought himself bound to recur to the legend of the mad maid, but his
&ldquo;crazed maiden&rdquo; is sane enough, sorrowful but dull, and
sings of her own &ldquo;burning brow,&rdquo; as Herrick&rsquo;s wild
one never sang; nor is there any smile in her story, though she talks
of flowers, or, rather, &ldquo;the herbs I loved to rear&rdquo;; and
perhaps she is the surest of all signs that the strange inspiration
of the past centuries was lost, vanished like Tom-a-Bedlam himself.&nbsp;
It had been wholly English, whereas the English eighteenth century was
not wholly English.</p>
<p>It is not to be imagined that any hard Southern mind could ever have
played in poetry with such a fancy; or that Petrarch, for example, could
so have foregone the manifestation of intelligence and intelligible
sentiment.&nbsp; And as to Dante, who put the two eternities into the
momentary balance of the human will, cold would be his disregard of
this northern dream of innocence.&nbsp; If the mad maid was an alien
upon earth, what were she in the Inferno?&nbsp; What word can express
her strangeness there, her vagrancy there?&nbsp; And with what eyes
would they see this dewy face glancing in at the windows of that City?</p>
<h2>LAUGHTER</h2>
<p>Times have been, it is said, merrier than these; but it is certain
nevertheless that laughter never was so honoured as now; were it not
for the paradox one might say, it never was so grave.&nbsp; Everywhere
the joke &ldquo;emerges&rdquo;&mdash;as an &ldquo;elegant&rdquo; writer
might have it&mdash;emerges to catch the attention of the sense of humour;
and everywhere the sense of humour wanders, watches, and waits to honour
the appeal.</p>
<p>It loiters, vaguely but perpetually willing.&nbsp; It wears (let
the violent personification be pardoned) a hanging lip, and a wrinkle
in abeyance, and an eye in suspense.&nbsp; It is much at the service
of the vagrant encounterer, and may be accosted by any chance daughters
of the game.&nbsp; It stands in untoward places, or places that were
once inappropriate, and is early at some indefinite appointment, some
ubiquitous tryst, with the compliant jest.</p>
<p>All literature becomes a field of easy assignations; there is a constant
signalling, an endless recognition.&nbsp; Forms of approach are remitted.&nbsp;
And the joke and the sense of humour, with no surprise of meeting, or
no gaiety of strangeness, so customary has the promiscuity become, go
up and down the pages of the paper and the book.&nbsp; See, again, the
theatre.&nbsp; A somewhat easy sort of comic acting is by so much the
best thing upon our present stage that little else can claim&mdash;paradox
again apart&mdash;to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>There is, in a word, a determination, an increasing tendency away
from the Oriental estimate of laughter as a thing fitter for women,
fittest for children, and unfitted for the beard.&nbsp; Laughter is
everywhere and at every moment proclaimed to be the honourable occupation
of men, and in some degree distinctive of men, and no mean part of their
prerogative and privilege.&nbsp; The sense of humour is chiefly theirs,
and those who are not men are to be admitted to the jest upon their
explanation.&nbsp; They will not refuse explanation.&nbsp; And there
is little upon which a man will so value himself as upon that sense,
&ldquo;in England, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it would be a pity if laughter should ever become, like
rhetoric and the arts, a habit.&nbsp; And it is in some sort a habit
when it is not inevitable.&nbsp; If we ask ourselves why we laugh, we
must confess that we laugh oftenest because&mdash;being amused&mdash;we
intend to show that we are amused.&nbsp; We are right to make the sign,
but a smile would be as sure a signal as a laugh, and more sincere;
it would but be changing the convention; and the change would restore
laughter itself to its own place.&nbsp; We have fallen into the way
of using it to prove something&mdash;our sense of the goodness of the
jest, to wit; but laughter should not thus be used, it should go free.&nbsp;
It is not a demonstration, whether in logic, or&mdash;as the word demonstration
is now generally used&mdash;in emotion; and we do ill to charge it with
that office.</p>
<p>Something of the Oriental idea of dignity might not be amiss among
such a people as ourselves containing wide and numerous classes who
laugh without cause: audiences; crowds; a great many clergymen, who
perhaps first fell into the habit in the intention of proving that they
were not gloomy; but a vast number of laymen also who had not that excuse;
and many women who laugh in their uncertainty as to what is humorous
and what is not.&nbsp; This last is the most harmless of all kinds of
superfluous laughter.&nbsp; When it carries an apology, a confession
of natural and genial ignorance, and when a gentle creature laughs a
laugh of hazard and experiment, she is to be more than forgiven.&nbsp;
What she must not do is to laugh a laugh of instruction, and as it were
retrieve the jest that was never worth the taking.</p>
<p>There are, besides, a few women who do not disturb themselves as
to a sense of humour, but who laugh from a sense of happiness.&nbsp;
Childish is that trick, and sweet.&nbsp; For children, who always laugh
because they must, and never by way of proof or sign, laugh only half
their laughs out of their sense of humour; they laugh the rest under
a mere stimulation: because of abounding breath and blood; because some
one runs behind them, for example, and movement does so jog their spirits
that their legs fail them, for laughter, without a jest.</p>
<p>If ever the day should come when men and women shall be content to
signal their perception of humour by the natural smile, and shall keep
the laugh for its own unpremeditated act, shall laugh seldom, and simply,
and not thrice at the same thing&mdash;once for foolish surprise, and
twice for tardy intelligence, and thrice to let it be known that they
are amused&mdash;then it may be time to persuade this laughing nation
not to laugh so loud as it is wont in public.&nbsp; The theatre audiences
of louder-speaking nations laugh lower than ours.&nbsp; The laugh that
is chiefly a signal of the laugher&rsquo;s sense of the ridiculous is
necessarily loud; and it has the disadvantage of covering what we may
perhaps wish to hear from the actors.&nbsp; It is a public laugh, and
no ordinary citizen is called upon for a public laugh.&nbsp; He may
laugh in public, but let it be with private laughter there.</p>
<p>Let us, if anything like a general reform be possible in these times
of dispersion and of scattering, keep henceforth our sense of humour
in a place better guarded, as something worth a measure of seclusion.&nbsp;
It should not loiter in wait for the alms of a joke in adventurous places.&nbsp;
For the sense of humour has other things to do than to make itself conspicuous
in the act of laughter.&nbsp; It has negative tasks of valid virtue;
for example, the standing and waiting within call of tragedy itself,
where, excluded, it may keep guard.</p>
<p>No reasonable man will aver that the Oriental manners are best.&nbsp;
This would be to deny Shakespeare as his comrades knew him, where the
wit &ldquo;out-did the meat, out-did the frolic wine,&rdquo; and to
deny Ben Jonson&rsquo;s &ldquo;tart Aristophanes, neat Terence, witty
Plautus,&rdquo; and the rest.&nbsp; Doubtless Greece determined the
custom for all our Occident; but none the less might the modern world
grow more sensible of the value of composure.</p>
<p>To none other of the several powers of our souls do we so give rein
as to this of humour, and none other do we indulge with so little fastidiousness.&nbsp;
It is as though there were honour in governing the other senses, and
honour in refusing to govern this.&nbsp; It is as though we were ashamed
of reason here, and shy of dignity, and suspicious of temperance, and
diffident of moderation, and too eager to thrust forward that which
loses nothing by seclusion.</p>
<h2>HARLEQUIN MERCUTIO</h2>
<p>The first time that Mercutio fell upon the English stage, there fell
with him a gay and hardly human figure; it fell, perhaps finally, for
English drama.&nbsp; That manner of man&mdash;Arlecchino, or Harlequin&mdash;had
outlived his playmates, Pantaleone, Brighella, Colombina, and the Clown.&nbsp;
A little of Pantaleone survives in old Capulet, a little in the father
of the Shrew, but the life of Mercutio in the one play, and of the subordinate
Tranio in the other, is less quickly spent, less easily put out, than
the smouldering of the old man.&nbsp; Arlecchino frolics in and out
of the tragedy and comedy of Shakespeare, until he thus dies in his
lightest, his brightest, his most vital shape.</p>
<p>Arlecchino, the tricksy and shifty spirit, the contriver, the busybody,
the trusty rogue, the wonder-worker, the man in disguise, the mercurial
one, lives on buoyantly in France to the age of Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp;
He is officious and efficacious in the skin of Mascarille and Ergaste
and Scapin; but he tends to be a lacquey, with a reference rather to
Antiquity and the Latin comedy than to the Middle Ages, as on the English
stage his mere memory survives differently to a later age in the person
of &ldquo;Charles, his friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; What convinces me that he
virtually died with Mercutio is chiefly this&mdash;that this comrade
of Romeo&rsquo;s lives so keenly as to be fully capable of the death
that he takes at Tybalt&rsquo;s sword-point; he lived indeed, he dies
indeed.&nbsp; Another thing that marks the close of a career of ages
is his loss of his long customary good luck.&nbsp; Who ever heard of
Arlecchino unfortunate before, at fault with his sword-play, overtaken
by tragedy?&nbsp; His time had surely come.&nbsp; The gay companion
was to bleed; Tybalt&rsquo;s sword had made a way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but it served.</p>
<p>Some confusion comes to pass among the typical figures of the primitive
Italian play, because Harlequin, on that conventional little stage of
the past, has a hero&rsquo;s place, whereas when he interferes in human
affairs he is only the auxiliary.&nbsp; He might be lover and bridegroom
on the primitive stage, in the comedy of these few and unaltered types;
but when Pantaloon, Clown, and Harlequin play with really human beings,
then Harlequin can be no more than a friend of the hero, the friend
of the bridegroom.&nbsp; The five figures of the old stage dance attendance;
they play around the business of those who have the dignity of mortality;
they, poor immortals&mdash;a clown who does not die, a pantaloon never
far from death, who yet does not die, a Columbine who never attains
Desdemona&rsquo;s death of innocence or Juliet&rsquo;s death of rectitude
and passion&mdash;flit in the backward places of the stage.</p>
<p>Ariel fulfils his office, and is not of one kind with those he serves.&nbsp;
Is there a memory of Harlequin in that delicate figure?&nbsp; Something
of the subservient immortality, of the light indignity, proper to Pantaleone,
Brighella, Arlecchino, Colombina, and the Clown, hovers away from the
stage when Ariel is released from the trouble of human things.</p>
<p>Immortality, did I say?&nbsp; It was immortality until Mercutio fell.&nbsp;
And if some claim be made to it still because Harlequin has transformed
so many scenes for the pleasure of so many thousand children, since
Mercutio died, I must reply that our modern Harlequin is no more than
a <i>marionnette</i>; he has returned whence he came.&nbsp; A man may
play him, but he is&mdash;as he was first of all&mdash;a doll.&nbsp;
From doll-hood Arlecchino took life, and, so promoted, flitted through
a thousand comedies, only to be again what he first was; save that,
as once a doll played the man, so now a man plays the doll.&nbsp; It
is but a memory of Arlecchino that our children see, a poor statue or
image endowed with mobility rather than with life.</p>
<p>With Mercutio, vanished the light heart that had given to the serious
ages of the world an hour&rsquo;s refuge from the unforgotten burden
of responsible conscience; the light heart assumed, borrowed, made dramatically
the spectator&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; We are not serious now, and no heart
now is quite light, even for an hour.</p>
<h2>THE LITTLE LANGUAGE</h2>
<p>Dialect is the elf rather than the genius of place, and a dwarfish
master of the magic of local things.</p>
<p>In England we hardly know what a concentrated homeliness it nourishes;
inasmuch as, with us, the castes and classes for whom Goldoni and Gallina
and Signor Fogazzaro have written in the patois of the Veneto, use no
dialect at all.</p>
<p>Neither Goldoni nor Gallina has charged the Venetian language with
so much literature as to take from the people the shelter of their almost
unwritten tongue.&nbsp; Signor Fogazzaro, bringing tragedy into the
homes of dialect, does but show us how the language staggers under such
a stress, how it breaks down, and resigns that office.&nbsp; One of
the finest of the characters in the ranks of his admirable fiction is
that old manageress of the narrow things of the house whose daughter
is dying insane.&nbsp; I have called the dialect a shelter.&nbsp; This
it is; but the poor lady does not cower within; her resigned head erect,
she is shut out from that homely refuge, suffering and inarticulate.&nbsp;
The two dramatists in their several centuries also recognized the inability
of the dialect.&nbsp; They laid none but light loads upon it.&nbsp;
They caused it to carry no more in their homely plays than it carries
in homely life.&nbsp; Their work leaves it what it was&mdash;the talk
of a people talking much about few things; a people like our own and
any other in their lack of literature, but local and all Italian in
their lack of silence.</p>
<p>Common speech is surely a greater part of life to such a people than
to one less pleased with chatter or more pleased with books.&nbsp; I
am writing of men, women, and children (and children are not forgotten,
since we share a patois with children on terms of more than common equality)
who possess, for all occasions of ceremony and opportunities of dignity,
a general, national, liberal, able, and illustrious tongue, charged
with all its history and all its achievements; for the speakers of dialect,
of a certain rank, speak Italian, too.&nbsp; But to tamper with their
dialect, or to take it from them, would be to leave them houseless and
exposed in their daily business.&nbsp; So much does their patois seem
to be their refuge from the heavy and multitudinous experiences of a
literary tongue, that the stopping of a fox&rsquo;s earth might be taken
as the image of any act that should spoil or stop the talk of the associated
seclusion of their town, and leave them in the bleakness of a larger
patriotism.</p>
<p>The Venetian people, the Genoese, and the other speakers of languages
that might all have proved right &ldquo;Italian&rdquo; had not Dante,
Petrarch and Boccaccio written in Tuscan, can neither write nor be taught
hard things in their dialect, although they can live, whether easy lives
or hard, and evidently can die, therein.&nbsp; The hands and feet that
have served the villager and the citizen at homely tasks have all the
lowliness of his patois, to his mind; and when he must perforce yield
up their employment, we may believe that it is a simple thing to die
in so simple and so narrow a language, one so comfortable, neighbourly,
tolerant, and compassionate; so confidential; so incapable, ignorant,
unappalling, inapt to wing any wearied thought upon difficult flight
or to spur it upon hard travelling.</p>
<p>Not without words is mental pain, or even physical pain, to be undergone;
but the words that have done no more than order the things of the narrow
street are not words to put a fine edge or a piercing point to any human
pang.&nbsp; It may even well be that to die in dialect is easier than
to die in the eloquence of Manfred, though that declaimed language,
too, is doubtless a defence, if one of a different manner.</p>
<p>These writers in Venetian&mdash;they are named because in no other
Italian dialect has work so popular as Goldoni&rsquo;s been done, nor
so excellent as Signor Fogazzaro&rsquo;s&mdash;have left the unlettered
local language in which they loved to deal, to its proper limitations.&nbsp;
They have not given weighty things into its charge, nor made it heavily
responsible.&nbsp; They have added nothing to it; nay, by writing it
they might even be said to have made it duller, had it not been for
the reader and the actor.&nbsp; Insomuch as the intense expressiveness
of a dialect&mdash;of a small vocabulary in the mouth of a dramatic
people&mdash;lies in the various accent wherewith a southern citizen
knows how to enrich his talk, it remains for the actor to restore its
life to the written phrase.&nbsp; In dialect the author is forbidden
to search for the word, for there is none lurking for his choice; but
of tones, allusions, and of references and inferences of the voice,
the speaker of dialect is a master.&nbsp; No range of phrases can be
his, but he has the more or the less confidential inflection, until
at times the close communication of the narrow street becomes a very
conspiracy.</p>
<p>Let it be borne in mind that dialect properly so called is something
all unlike, for instance, the mere jargon of London streets.&nbsp; The
difference may be measured by the fact that Italian dialects have a
highly organized and orderly grammar.&nbsp; The Londoner cannot keep
the small and loose order of the grammar of good English; the Genoese
conjugates his patois verbs, with subjunctives and all things of that
handsome kind, lacked by the English of Universities.</p>
<p>The middle class&mdash;the <i>piccolo</i> <i>mondo&mdash;</i>that
shares Italian dialect with the poor are more strictly local in their
manners than either the opulent or the indigent of the same city.&nbsp;
They have moreover the busy intelligence (which is the intellect of
patois) at its keenest.&nbsp; Their speech keeps them a sequestered
place which is Italian, Italian beyond the ken of the traveller, and
beyond the reach of alteration.&nbsp; And&mdash;what is pretty to observe&mdash;the
speakers are well conscious of the characters of this intimate language.&nbsp;
An Italian countryman who has known no other climate will vaunt, in
fervent platitudes, his Italian sun; in like manner he is conscious
of the local character of his language, and tucks himself within it
at home, whatever Tuscan he may speak abroad.&nbsp; A properly spelt
letter, Swift said, would seem to expose him and Mrs Dingley and Stella
to the eyes of the world; but their little language, ill-written, was
&ldquo;snug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lovers have made a little language in all times; finding the nobler
language insufficient, do they ensconce themselves in the smaller? discard
noble and literary speech as not noble enough, and in despair thus prattle
and gibber and stammer?&nbsp; Rather perhaps this departure from English
is but an excursion after gaiety.&nbsp; The ideal lovers, no doubt,
would be so simple as to be grave.&nbsp; That is a tenable opinion.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, age by age they have been gay; and age by age they have
exchanged language imitated from the children they doubtless never studied,
and perhaps never loved.&nbsp; Why so?&nbsp; They might have chosen
broken English of other sorts&mdash;that, for example, which was once
thought amusing in farce, as spoken by the Frenchman conceived by the
Englishman&mdash;a complication of humour fictitious enough, one might
think, to please anyone; or else a fragment of negro dialect; or the
style of telegrams; or the masterly adaptation of the simple savage&rsquo;s
English devised by Mrs Plornish in her intercourse with the Italian.&nbsp;
But none of these found favour.&nbsp; The choice has always been of
the language of children.&nbsp; Let us suppose that the flock of winged
Loves worshipping Venus in the Titian picture, and the noble child that
rides his lion erect with a background of Venetian gloomy dusk, may
be the inspirers of those prattlings.&nbsp; &ldquo;See then thy selfe
likewise art lyttle made,&rdquo; says Spenser&rsquo;s Venus to her child.</p>
<p>Swift was the best prattler.&nbsp; He had caught the language, surprised
it in Stella when she was veritably a child.&nbsp; He did not push her
clumsily back into a childhood he had not known; he simply prolonged
in her a childhood he had loved.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;seepy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nite, dealest dea, nite dealest logue.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a real
good-night.&nbsp; It breathes tenderness from that moody and uneasy
bed of projects.</p>
<h2>ANIMA PELLEGRINA!</h2>
<p>Every language in the world has its own phrase, fresh for the stranger&rsquo;s
fresh and alien sense of its signal significance; a phrase that is its
own essential possession, and yet is dearer to the speaker of other
tongues.&nbsp; Easily&mdash;shall I say cheaply?&mdash;spiritual, for
example, was the nation that devised the name <i>anima</i> <i>pellegrina</i>,
wherewith to crown a creature admired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pilgrim soul&rdquo;
is a phrase for any language, but &ldquo;pilgrim soul!&rdquo; addressed,
singly and sweetly to one who cannot be over-praised, &ldquo;pilgrim-soul!&rdquo;
is a phrase of fondness, the high homage of a lover, of one watching,
of one who has no more need of common flatteries, but has admired and
gazed while the object of his praises visibly surpassed them&mdash;this
is the facile Italian ecstasy, and it rises into an Italian heaven.</p>
<p>It was by chance, and in an old play, that I came upon this impetuous,
sudden, and single sentence of admiration, as it were a sentence of
life passed upon one charged with inestimable deeds; and the modern
editor had thought it necessary to explain the exclamation by a note.&nbsp;
It was, he said, poetical.</p>
<p><i>Anima</i> <i>pellegrina</i> seems to be Italian of no later date
than Pergolese&rsquo;s airs, and suits the time as the familiar phrase
of the more modern love-song suited the day of Bellini.&nbsp; But it
is only Italian, bygone Italian, and not a part of the sweet past of
any other European nation, but only of this.</p>
<p>To the same local boundaries and enclosed skies belongs the charm
of those buoyant words:-</p>
<blockquote><p>Felice chi vi mira,<br />
Ma pi&ugrave; felice chi per voi sospira!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is not only a charm of elastic sound or of grace; that would
be but a property of the turn of speech.&nbsp; It is rather the profounder
advantage whereby the rhymes are freighted with such feeling as the
very language keeps in store.&nbsp; In another tongue you may sing,
&ldquo;happy who looks, happier who sighs&rdquo;; but in what other
tongue shall the little meaning be so sufficient, and in what other
shall you get from so weak an antithesis the illusion of a lovely intellectual
epigram?&nbsp; Yet it is not worthy of an English reader to call it
an illusion; he should rather be glad to travel into the place of a
language where the phrase <i>is</i> intellectual, impassioned, and an
epigram; and should thankfully for the occasion translate himself, and
not the poetry.</p>
<p>I have been delighted to use a present current phrase whereof the
charm may still be unknown to Englishmen&mdash;&ldquo;<i>piuttosto</i>
<i>bruttini</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; See what an all-Italian spirit is here,
and what contempt, not reluctant, but tolerant and familiar.&nbsp; You
may hear it said of pictures, or works of art of several kinds, and
you confess at once that not otherwise should they be condemned.&nbsp;
<i>Brutto</i>&mdash;ugly&mdash;is the word of justice, the word for
any language, everywhere translatable, a circular note, to be exchanged
internationally with a general meaning, wholesale, in the course of
the European concert.&nbsp; But <i>bruttino</i> is a soothing diminutive,
a diminutive that forbears to express contempt, a diminutive that implies
innocence, and is, moreover, guarded by a hesitating adverb, shrugging
in the rear&mdash;&ldquo;rather than not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather
ugly than not, and ugly in a little way that we need say few words about&mdash;the
fewer the better;&rdquo; nay, this paraphrase cannot achieve the homely
Italian quality whereby the printed and condemnatory criticism is made
a family affair that shall go no further.&nbsp; After the sound of it,
the European concert seems to be composed of brass instruments.</p>
<p>How unlike is the house of English language and the enclosure into
which a traveller hither has to enter!&nbsp; Do we possess anything
here more essentially ours (though we share it with our sister Germany)
than our particle &ldquo;un&rdquo;?&nbsp; Poor are those living languages
that have not our use of so rich a negative.&nbsp; The French equivalent
in adjectives reaches no further than the adjective itself&mdash;or
hardly; it does not attain the participle; so that no French or Italian
poet has the words &ldquo;unloved&rdquo;, &ldquo;unforgiven.&rdquo;&nbsp;
None such, therefore, has the opportunity of the gravest and the most
majestic of all ironies.&nbsp; In our English, the words that are denied
are still there&mdash;&ldquo;loved,&rdquo; &ldquo;forgiven&rdquo;: excluded
angels, who stand erect, attesting what is not done, what is undone,
what shall not be done.</p>
<p>No merely opposite words could have so much denial, or so much pain
of loss, or so much outer darkness, or so much barred beatitude in sight.&nbsp;
All-present, all-significant, all-remembering, all-foretelling is the
word, and it has a plenitude of knowledge.</p>
<p>We have many more conspicuous possessions that are, like this, proper
to character and thought, and by no means only an accident of untransferable
speech.&nbsp; And it is impossible for a reader, who is a lover of languages
for their spirit, to pass the words of untravelled excellence, proper
to their own garden enclosed, without recognition.&nbsp; Never may they
be disregarded or confounded with the universal stock.&nbsp; If I would
not so neglect <i>piuttosto</i> <i>bruttini</i>, how much less a word
dominating literature!&nbsp; And of such words of ascendancy and race
there is no great English author but has abundant possession.&nbsp;
No need to recall them.&nbsp; But even writers who are not great have,
here and there, proved their full consciousness of their birthright.&nbsp;
Thus does a man who was hardly an author, Haydon the painter, put out
his hand to take his rights.&nbsp; He has incomparable language when
he is at a certain page of his life; at that time he sate down to sketch
his child, dying in its babyhood, and the head he studied was, he says,
full of &ldquo;power and grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a phrase of different discovery from that which reveals a
local rhyme-balanced epigram, a gracious antithesis, taking an intellectual
place&mdash;<i>Felice</i> <i>chi</i> <i>vi</i> <i>mira&mdash;</i>or
the art-critic&rsquo;s phrase&mdash;<i>piuttosto</i> <i>bruttini&mdash;</i>of
easy, companionable, and equal contempt.</p>
<p>As for French, if it had no other sacred words&mdash;and it has many&mdash;who
would not treasure the language that has given us&mdash;no, not that
has given us, but that has kept for its own&mdash;<i>ensoleill&egrave;</i>?&nbsp;
Nowhere else is the sun served with such a word.&nbsp; It is not to
be said or written without a convincing sense of sunshine, and from
the very word come light and radiation.&nbsp; The unaccustomed north
could not have made it, nor the accustomed south, but only a nation
part-north and part-south; therefore neither England nor Italy can rival
it.&nbsp; But there needed also the senses of the French&mdash;those
senses of which they say far too much in every second-class book of
their enormous, their general second-class, but which they have matched
in their time with some inimitable words.&nbsp; Perhaps that matching
was done at the moment of the full literary consciousness of the senses,
somewhere about the famous 1830.&nbsp; For I do not think <i>ensoleill&egrave;</i>
to be a much older word&mdash;I make no assertion.&nbsp; Whatever its
origin, may it have no end!&nbsp; They cannot weary us with it; for
it seems as new as the sun, as remote as old Provence; village, hill-side,
vineyard, and chestnut wood shine in the splendour of the word, the
air is light, and white things passing blind the eyes&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s
linen, white cattle, shining on the way from shadow to shadow.&nbsp;
A word of the sense of sight, and a summer word, in short, compared
with which the paraphrase is but a picture.&nbsp; For <i>ensoleill&egrave;</i>
I would claim the consent of all readers&mdash;that they shall all acknowledge
the spirit of that French.&nbsp; But perhaps it is a mere personal preference
that makes <i>le</i> <i>jour</i> <i>s&rsquo;annonce</i> also sacred.</p>
<p>If the hymn, &ldquo;Stabat Mater dolorosa,&rdquo; was written in
Latin, this could be only that it might in time find its true language
and incomparable phrase at last&mdash;that it might await the day of
life in its proper German.&nbsp; I found it there (and knew at once
the authentic verse, and knew at once for what tongue it had been really
destined) in the pages of the prayer-book of an apple-woman at an Innsbruck
church, and in the accents of her voice.</p>
<h2>THE SEA WALL</h2>
<p>A singular love of walls is mine.&nbsp; Perhaps because of childish
association with mountain-climbing roads narrow in the bright shadows
of grey stone, hiding olive trees whereof the topmost leaves prick above
into the blue; or perhaps because of subsequent living in London, with
its too many windows and too few walls, the city which of all capitals
takes least visible hold upon the ground; or for the sake of some other
attraction or aversion, walls, blank and strong, reaching outward at
the base, are a satisfaction to the eyes teased by the inexpressive
peering of windows, by that weak lapse and shuffling which is the London
&ldquo;area,&rdquo; and by the helpless hollows of shop-fronts.</p>
<p>I would rather have a wall than any rail but a very good one of wrought-iron.&nbsp;
A wall is the safeguard of simplicity.&nbsp; It lays a long level line
among the indefinite chances of the landscape.&nbsp; But never more
majestic than in face of the wild sea, the wall, steadying its slanting
foot upon the rock, builds in the serried ilex-wood and builds out the
wave.&nbsp; The sea-wall is the wall at its best.&nbsp; And fine as
it is on the strong coast, it is beautiful on the weak littoral and
the imperilled levels of a northern beach.</p>
<p>That sea wall is low and long; sea-pinks grow on the salt grass that
passes away into shingle at its foot.&nbsp; It is at close quarters
with the winter sea, when, from the low coast with its low horizon,
the sky-line of sea is jagged.&nbsp; Never from any height does the
ocean-horizon show thus broken and battered at its very verge, but from
the flat coast and the narrow world you can see the wave as far as you
can see the water; and the stormy light of a clear horizon is seen to
be mobile and shifting with the buoyant hillocks and their restless
line.</p>
<p>Nowhere in Holland does there seem to be such a low sea-wall as secures
many a mile of gentle English coast to the east.&nbsp; The Dutch dyke
has not that aspect of a lowly parapet against a tide; it springs with
a look of haste and of height; and when you first run upstairs from
the encumbered Dutch fields to look at the sea, there is nothing in
the least like England; and even the Englishman of to-day is apt to
share something of the old perversity that was minded to cast derision
upon the Dutch in their encounters with the tides.</p>
<p>There has been some fault in the Dutch, making them subject to the
slight derision of the nations who hold themselves to be more romantic,
and, as it were, more slender.&nbsp; We English, once upon a time, did
especially flout the little nation then acting a history that proved
worth the writing.&nbsp; It may be no more than a brief perversity that
has set a number of our writers to cheer the memory of Charles II.&nbsp;
Perhaps, even, it is no more than another rehearsal of that untiring
success at the expense of the bourgeois.&nbsp; The bourgeois would be
more simple than, in fact, he is were he to stand up every time to be
shocked; but, perhaps, the image of his dismay is enough to reward the
fancy of those who practise the wanton art.&nbsp; And, when all is done,
who performs for any but an imaginary audience?&nbsp; Surely those companies
of spectators and of auditors are not the least of the makings of an
author.&nbsp; A few men and women he achieves within his books; but
others does he create without, and to those figures of all illusion
makes the appeal of his art.&nbsp; More candid is the author who has
no world, but turns that appeal inwards to his own heart.&nbsp; He has
at least a living hearer.</p>
<p>This is by the way.&nbsp; Charles II has been cheered; the feat is
done, the dismay is imagined with joy.&nbsp; And yet the Merry Monarch&rsquo;s
was a dismal time.&nbsp; Plague, fire, the arrears of pension from the
French King remembered and claimed by the restored throne of England,
and the Dutch in the Medway&mdash;all this was disaster.&nbsp; None
the less, having the vanity of new clothes and a pretty figure, did
we&mdash;especially by the mouth of Andrew Marvell&mdash;deride our
victors, making sport of the Philistines with a proper national sense
of enjoyment of such physical disabilities, or such natural difficulties,
or such misfavour of fortune, as may beset the alien.</p>
<p>Especially were the denials of fortune matter for merriment.&nbsp;
They are so still; or they were so certainly in the day when a great
novelist found the smallness of some South German States to be the subject
of unsating banter.&nbsp; The German scenes at the end of &ldquo;Vanity
Fair,&rdquo; for example, may prove how much the ridicule of mere smallness,
fewness, poverty (and not even real poverty, privation, but the poverty
that shows in comparison with the gold of great States, and is properly
in proportion) rejoiced the sense of humour in a writer and moralist
who intended to teach mankind to be less worldly.&nbsp; In Andrew Marvell&rsquo;s
day they were even more candid.&nbsp; The poverty of privation itself
was provocative of the sincere laughter of the inmost man, the true,
infrequent laughter of the heart.&nbsp; Marvell, the Puritan, laughed
that very laughter&mdash;at leanness, at hunger, cold, and solitude&mdash;in
the face of the world, and in the name of literature, in one memorable
satire.&nbsp; I speak of &ldquo;Flecno, an English Priest in Rome,&rdquo;
wherein nothing is spared&mdash;not the smallness of the lodging, nor
the lack of a bed, nor the scantiness of clothing, nor the fast.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This basso-rilievo of a man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>personal meagreness is the first joke and the last.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at that he should find in the smallness
of the country of Holland matter for a cordial jest.&nbsp; But, besides
the smallness, there was that accidental and natural disadvantage in
regard to the sea.&nbsp; In the Venetians, commerce with the sea, conflict
with the sea, a victory over the sea, and the ensuing peace&mdash;albeit
a less instant battle and a more languid victory&mdash;were confessed
to be noble; in the Dutch they were grotesque.&nbsp; &ldquo;With mad
labour,&rdquo; says Andrew Marvell, with the spirited consciousness
of the citizen of a country well above ground and free to watch the
labour at leisure, &ldquo;with mad labour&rdquo; did the Dutch &ldquo;fish
the land to shore.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>How did they rivet with gigantic piles,<br />
Thorough the centre, their new-catched miles,<br />
And to the stake a struggling country bound,<br />
Where barking waves still bait the forced ground;<br />
Building their watery Babel far more high<br />
To reach the sea than those to scale the sky!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is done with a jolly wit, and in what admirable couplets!</p>
<blockquote><p>The fish oft-times the burgher dispossessed,<br />
And sat, not as a meat, but as a guest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is even better sport that the astonished tritons and sea-nymphs
should find themselves provided with a capital <i>cabillau</i> of shoals
of pickled Dutchmen (heeren for herring, says Marvell); and it must
be allowed that he rhymes with the enjoyment of irony.&nbsp; There is
not a smile for us in &ldquo;Flecno,&rdquo; but it is more than possible
to smile over this &ldquo;Character of Holland&rdquo;; at the excluded
ocean returning to play at leap-frog over the steeples; at the rise
of government and authority in Holland, which belonged of right to the
man who could best invent a shovel or a pump, the country being so leaky:-</p>
<blockquote><p>Not who first sees the rising sun commands,<br />
But who could first discern the rising lands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have lost something more than the delighted laughter of Marvell,
more than his practical joke, and more than the heart that was light
in so burly a frame&mdash;we have lost with these the wild humour that
wore so well the bonds of two equal lines, and was wild with so much
order, invention, malice, gaiety, polish, equilibrium, and vitality&mdash;in
a word, the Couplet, the couplet of the past.&nbsp; We who cannot stand
firm within two lines, but must slip beyond and between the boundaries,
who tolerate the couplets of Keats and imitate them, should praise the
day of Charles II because of Marvell&rsquo;s art, and not for love of
the sorry reign.&nbsp; We had plague, fire, and the Dutch in the Medway,
but we had the couplet; and there were also the measures of those more
poetic poets, hitherto called somewhat slightingly the Cavalier poets,
who matched the wit of the Puritan with a spirit simpler and less mocking.</p>
<p>It was against an English fortress, profoundly walled, that some
remembered winter storms lately turned their great artillery.&nbsp;
It was a time of resounding nights; the sky was so clamorous and so
close, up in the towers of the seaside stronghold, that one seemed to
be indeed admitted to the perturbed counsels of the winds.&nbsp; The
gale came with an indescribable haste, hooting as it flew; it seemed
to break itself upon the heights, yet passed unbroken out to sea; in
the voice of the sea there were pauses, but none in that of the urgent
gale with its hoo-hoo-hoo all night, that clamoured down the calling
of the waves.&nbsp; That lack of pauses was the strangest thing in the
tempest, because the increase of sound seemed to imply a lull before.&nbsp;
The lull was never perceptible, but the lift was always an alarm.&nbsp;
The onslaught was instant, where would it stop?&nbsp; What was the secret
extreme to which this hurry and force were tending?&nbsp; You asked
less what thing was driving the flocks of the storm than what was drawing
them.&nbsp; The attraction seemed the greater violence, the more irresistible,
and the more unknown.&nbsp; And there were moments when the end seemed
about to be attained.</p>
<p>The wind struck us hasty blows, and unawares we borrowed, to describe
it, words fit for the sharp strokes of material things; but the fierce
gale is soft.&nbsp; Along the short grass, trembling and cowering flat
on the scarped hill-side, against the staggering horse, against the
flint walls, one with the rock they grasp, the battery of the tempest
is a quick and enormous softness.&nbsp; What down, what sand, what deep
moss, what elastic wave could match the bed and cushion of the gale?</p>
<p>This storm tossed the wave and the stones of the sea-wall up together.&nbsp;
The next day it left the waters white with the thrilling whiteness of
foam in sunshine.&nbsp; It was only the Channel; and in such narrow
waters you do not see the distances, the wide levels of fleeting and
floating foam, that lie light between long wave and long wave on a Mediterranean
coast, regions of delicate and transitory brightness so far out that
all the waves, near and far, seem to be breaking at the same moment,
one beyond the other, and league beyond league, into foam.&nbsp; But
the Channel has its own strong, short curl that catches the rushing
shingle up with the freshest of all noises and runs up with sudden curves,
white upon the white sea-wall, under the random shadow of sea-gulls
and the light of a shining cloud.</p>
<h2>THE DAFFODIL</h2>
<p>To travel eastwards and breast the sun, to sail towards the watershed
and breast the floods, to go north and breast the winter&mdash;fresh
and warm are the energies of such bracing action; but more animating
still is it to live so as to breast the stress of time.</p>
<p>Man and woman may, like the child, or almost like him, fill the time
and enlarge the capacity of the day&mdash;our poor day that so easily
shrinks and dwindles in the careless possession of idle minds.&nbsp;
The date, every first of March, for example, may sweep upon a large
curve and come home annually after a swinging flight.&nbsp; To the infinite
variety of natural days may be entrusted half the work of strengthening
the flight against time, but the other half must be the task of the
vehement heart.&nbsp; Nature assuredly does not fail.&nbsp; Days, seasons,
and years are as wide asunder as the unforeseen can set them, and a
crowd of children is not more various.&nbsp; But the resisting heart
seems of late to be somewhat lacking.&nbsp; We are inclined to turn
our heel upon the East, upon the watershed, upon the gates of the wind,
and to go the smooth road.</p>
<p>We are even precipitate, and whip our way faster on the time-killing
course than the natural event would take us.&nbsp; It is not enough
that we should run helplessly, we outstrip the breeze and outsail the
current with the ease of our untimely luxuries.&nbsp; Our daffodils
are no longer to have the praise of their daring, for we no longer relate
them to the lagging swallow.&nbsp; By the time the barely budding woods
give a poor man&rsquo;s lodging to the cold daffodil&mdash;a scanty
kind taking the wind with a short stalk and giving it but small petals
to buffet&mdash;we have already said farewell to the tall and splendid
green-house daffodil that never braved the cold.&nbsp; We gave to this
our untimely welcome long before the snowdrop came, and the golden name
of daffodil has lost its vernal sound.&nbsp; And when we part with the
improved creature, lofty and enlarged, we hardly know or care whether
the starveling is yet mustering in hollows of woodlands, or whether
it is over or to come.&nbsp; We are attending to a yellower tulip, no
doubt, when the only daffodil that Shakespeare knew is opening in the
chilly wood.</p>
<p>The reproach is a commonplace, but perhaps we have generally accused
ourselves of the impatience rather than of the listlessness, and have
not noted how we shorten the disarranged seasons and lay up for ourselves
memories confused and undefined.&nbsp; Late springs and early, gentle
and hard, are compelled to yield the same colours; haste has its way
and its revenges.&nbsp; If we are resolved to live quickly, why, nothing
is easier.&nbsp; There are no such brief days as those that are indistinct;
and the sliding on the way of time is, of all habits, the most tyrannously
careless.&nbsp; It is first a laxity, then a habit, and next a folly;
and when we keep neither Ash Wednesday nor the birthday of daffodils,
and have hardly felt the cold, and do not know where the sun rises,
we are already on the way of least resistance, the friction of life
is gone; and in our last old age the past will seem to dwindle even
like the dwindled present of our decline.</p>
<p>There has been one unconscious operation of the love of life, one
single grasp after variety, intended to save the year, to face it, to
meet it, to compel it to show a unique face and bear a name of its own;
and this is travel.&nbsp; It is the finest and most effectual flight
against time of all.&nbsp; What elastic days are those wherein I make
head against a travelling landscape, meet histories and boundaries,
hail frontiers, face a new manner of building, cross the regions of
silver roofs and of heavy Alpine stone, and bring with me the late light
upon billowy gables and red eaves!&nbsp; And how buoyant the week in
which I anticipate the sun upon the roofless east!&nbsp; How serried
are the days with forests, how enlarged by plains, how thronged by cities,
how singled by the pine, how newly audible by a new sea!&nbsp; Far was
the sunrise from the sunset, and noon is one memorable midday with shortened
shadows upon some solitary road.</p>
<p>Our fathers had friction of another kind: hardship at home, winters
and nights that were dark with a darkness we have abolished; springs
that brought an infinite releasing, illumination, and recolouring.&nbsp;
None of us has seen the sight, or breathed the air, or heard those emancipated
voices.&nbsp; The bloom, the birds, the ifted sky!&nbsp; Bright nights
and glowing houses have surely robbed us of that variety, and all these
untimely fruits and flowers have suppressed even the small privations
of a winter in disguise.</p>
<p>In those days Englishmen had to breast the times as they were.&nbsp;
They had the privilege of their latitude&mdash;vigorous and rigorous
seasons.&nbsp; They had a year full of change&mdash;their time was stretched
whether with impatience or with patience, with conflict or with felicity.&nbsp;
Their salt meats were not the worst of it; there was the siege of darkness,
the captivity of cold, the threat of storm, and the labour to close
with the closing enemy, to break ways and save animals alive, and keep
the laws in force in the street in the long and secret nights.&nbsp;
From such a season of winter at home, winter well known, men broke free
to hail their daffodils.&nbsp; They found them, short, strong, and shivering,
in the still open and undefended woods.&nbsp; In the springs before
Chaucer, and earlier than the day of the first spring lyric, in the
same places grew the keen wild flowers as now; but they assuredly were
marked with another welcome; they made memories; this year&rsquo;s wild
harvest was not confused with that of last year, or of half-a-score
of years gone by.&nbsp; Distance of vital time set the springs far apart,
and made the daffodils strangers.</p>
<p>They were greeted with the courtesy due to strangers, so fresh must
have been the senses of the villager, and of the citizen of the village
town.&nbsp; Suburbs divide a city from the fields as walls did never.&nbsp;
He of old went from a little town, close and serried as a new box of
toys, with one step into the unsmirched country, carrying an unsated
heart.&nbsp; Refreshed with the animating compulsion of changeful life
were man and woman, and much like their child in a constant capacity
for unique experiences, unique days, years that are separate, known,
and distinguishable, and not only separate but long.</p>
<p>Indeed, some of us who travel hardly know how to remedy our fugitive,
resembling, hastening, and collapsing seasons, even by means of this
sovereign remedy of travel.&nbsp; It is to be feared that a modern journey
is not always to us so bracing a manner of living as was the untravelled
journey of hard days at home to the ancient islander.&nbsp; To journey
as he did, keeping his feet, with a moving heart against the moving
seasons, to resist, to withstand, widened the hours; but his posterity
are taking all means to narrow their own, even on the railway.&nbsp;
To go the same way every year, for instance, is to lose, when a few
such years are gone, nearly all the gain to life.&nbsp; To take no heed
at all of the way, but merely to be by any means at the end of the travelling,
to sleep or go by night, and to calculate Europe by hours, half-hours,
junctions, and dining-cars, is but to close up the time as though you
closed a telescope.&nbsp; A long railway journey and a long motor journey
may be taken with the flight of time as well as against it, and the
habit of summaries can use these too to its own end.&nbsp; Precipitate,
unresisting, are the day in the train and the heedless night.&nbsp;
We love to reproach ourselves with living at too great a speed, having,
perhaps, no sense of the second meaning of the phrase.&nbsp; Medicine
may, perhaps, fulfil her promise of giving us a few more years, but
habit derides her by making each year a scanty gift.</p>
<p>Much, too, of the spirit of time is lost to us because we will not
let the sun rule the day.&nbsp; He would see to it that our hours were
various; but we have preferred to his various face the plain face of
a clock, and the lights without vicissitudes of our nights without seasons.</p>
<h2>ADDRESSES</h2>
<p>Not free from some ignominious attendance upon the opinion of the
world is he who too consciously withdraws his affairs from its judgements.&nbsp;
He is indebted to &ldquo;the public.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is at least indebted
to it for the fact that there is, yonder, without, a public.&nbsp; Lacking
this excluded multitude his fastidiousness would have no subject, and
his singularity no contrast.&nbsp; He would, in his grosser moods, have
nothing to refuse, and nothing, in his finer, to ignore.</p>
<p>He, at any rate, is one, and the rest are numerous.&nbsp; They minister
to him popular errors.&nbsp; But if they are nothing else in regard
to himself, they are many.&nbsp; If he must have distinction, it is
there on easy terms&mdash;he is one.</p>
<p>Well for him if he does not contract the heavier debt shouldered
by the man who owes to the unknown, un-named, and uncounted his pleasure
in their conjectured or implicit envy; who conceives the jealousy they
may have covertly to endure, enjoys it, and thus silently begins and
ends within his own morosity the story of his base advantage.</p>
<p>Vanity has indignity as its underside.&nbsp; And how shall even the
pleasure in beauty be altogether without it?&nbsp; For since beauty,
like other human things, is comparative, how shall the praise, or the
admiration, thereof be free from (at least) some reference to the unbeautiful?&nbsp;
Or from some allusion to the less beautiful?&nbsp; Yet this, if inevitable,
is little; it may be negligible.&nbsp; The triumph of beauty is all
but innocent.&nbsp; It is where no beauty is in question that lurks
the unconfessed appeal to envy.&nbsp; That appeal is not an appeal to
admiration&mdash;it lacks what is the genial part of egoism.&nbsp; For
who, except perhaps a recent writer of articles on society in America,
really admires a man for living in the approved part of Boston?</p>
<p>The vanity of addresses is as frequent with us as on the western
side of the Atlantic.&nbsp; It is a vanity without that single apology
for vanity&mdash;gaiety of heart.&nbsp; The first things that are, in
London, sacrificed to it are the beautiful day and the facing of the
sky.&nbsp; There are some amongst us whose wives have constrained them
to dwell underground for love of an address.&nbsp; Modern and foolish
is that contempt for daylight.&nbsp; To the simple, day is beautiful;
and &ldquo;beautiful as day&rdquo; a happy proverb.</p>
<p>Over all colour, flesh, aspect, surface, manifestation of vitality,
dwells one certain dominance.&nbsp; And if One, vigilant for the dues
of His vicegerent, should ask us whose is the image and superscription?&nbsp;
We reply, The Sun&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The London air shortens and clips those beams, and yet leaves daylight
the finest thing we know.&nbsp; Beauty of artificial lights is in our
streets at night, but their chief beauty is when, just before night,
they adorn the day.&nbsp; The late daylight honours them when it so
easily and sweetly subdues and overcomes them, giving to the electric
lamp, to the taper, to the hearth fire, and to the spark, a loveliness
not their own.</p>
<p>With the unpublished desire to be envied, whereto here and there
amongst us is sacrificed the sky, abides the desire for an object of
unconfessed contempt.&nbsp; Both are contrary to that more authentic,
that essential solitariness wherein a few men have the grace to live,
and wherein all men are compelled to die.&nbsp; Both are unpublished
even now, even in our days, when it costs men so little to manifest
the effrontery of their opinions.</p>
<p>The difference between our worldliness and the New-worldliness is
chiefly that here we are apt to remove, by a little space, the distinction
brought about by riches, to put it back, to interpose, between it and
our actual life, a generation or two, an education or two.&nbsp; Obviously,
it was riches that made the class differences, if not now, then a little
time ago.&nbsp; Therefore the New England citizen should not be reproved
by us for anything except his too great candour.&nbsp; A social guide-book
to some city of the Republic is in my hands.&nbsp; I note how the very
names of streets take a sound of veneration or of cheerful derision
from the writer&rsquo;s pen.&nbsp; It is evident that the names are
almost enough.&nbsp; They have an expression.&nbsp; He is like a <i>na&iuml;f</i>
teller of humorous anecdotes, who cannot keep his own smiles in order
till he have done.</p>
<p>This social writer has scorn, as an author should, and he wreaks
it upon parishes.&nbsp; He turns me a phrase with the northern end of
a town and makes an epigram of the southern.&nbsp; He caps a sarcasm
with an address.</p>
<p>In truth, we too might write social guide-books to the same effect,
had we the same simplicity.&nbsp; It is to be thought that we too hold
an address, be it a good one, so closely that if Fortune should see
fit to snatch it from us, she must needs do so with violence.&nbsp;
Such unseemly violence, in this as in other transactions, is ours in
the clinging and not hers in the taking.&nbsp; For equal is the force
of Fortune, and steady is her grasp, whether she despoil the great of
their noble things or strip the mean of things ignoble, whether she
take from the clutching or the yielding hand.</p>
<p>Strange are the little traps laid by the Londoner so as to capture
an address by the hem if he may.&nbsp; You would think a good address
to be of all blessings the most stationary, and one to be either gained
or missed, and no two ways about it.&nbsp; But not so.&nbsp; You shall
see it waylaid at the angles of squares, with no slight exercise of
skill, delayed, entreated, detained, entangled, intricately caught,
persuaded to round a corner, prolonged beyond all probability, pursued.</p>
<p>One address there will in the future be for us, and few will visit
there.&nbsp; It will bear the number of a narrow house.&nbsp; May it
avow its poverty and be poor; for the obscure inhabitant, in frigid
humility, shall have no thought nor no eye askance upon the multitude.</p>
<h2>THE AUDIENCE</h2>
<p>The long laugh that sometimes keeps the business of the stage waiting
is only a sign of the exchange of parts that in the theatre every night
takes place.&nbsp; The audience are the players.&nbsp; Their audience
on the stage are bound to watch them, to understand them, to anticipate
them, and to divine them.&nbsp; But once known and their character established
in relation to a particular play, the audience&mdash;what is called
the audience&mdash;need give no further trouble.&nbsp; They themselves
cannot alter; they are fixed and compelled by the tremendous force of
averages.&nbsp; The most inexorable of laws, and the most irresistible
of necessities are upon them; they cannot do otherwise; they are out
of the reach of accidents; they are made fast in their own mediocrity.&nbsp;
They are a thousand London people; and no genius, or no imbecility,
amongst them has any effect upon that secure sovereignty of a number.</p>
<p>The long laugh generally means that the house&mdash;by its unalterable
majority&mdash;has laughed at one joke three times.&nbsp; The stage
waits upon the audience, and the audience rehearses its collective and
inevitable laugh.&nbsp; It performs.&nbsp; It communicates itself, and
art is a communication.&nbsp; A small and chosen party is made up, behind
the footlights, to see a thousand people, given helpless into the hands
of destiny and subject to averages, so express themselves.</p>
<p>The audience&rsquo;s audience (the people on the stage) are persuaded
into applauding the laugh too long and too often.&nbsp; The author is,
of course, one of them, and he applauds by making too many such translations.&nbsp;
They are perhaps worth making, and even worth renewing in acknowledgement
of a smile; but it is surely to encourage the house unduly to make them
so important.&nbsp; The actors applaud their audience by repeating&mdash;and
not once or only twice&mdash;a piece of comic business.&nbsp; Does the
Average laugh so well as indeed to deserve all this?</p>
<p>The Average does little more than laugh.&nbsp; It knows that its
own truest talents are indubitably comic.&nbsp; We have no real tragic
audiences.&nbsp; This is no expression of regret over legitimate audiences,
or audiences of the old school, or any audiences of that kind, whose
day may or may not have had a date.&nbsp; It is a mere statement of
the fact that audiences have lost, or never had, a distinguishing perception
of emotion, whereas they have every kind of perception of humour, distinguishing
and general.&nbsp; Their laugh never fails.&nbsp; If their friends behind
would really care to improve them, it might be done by exacting from
them a little more temperance in their sense of comedy.&nbsp; We shall
never have a really good school of audience without the exercise of
some such severity.</p>
<p>For obviously when we call an average unchangeable, we mean that
it is unchangeable for its time merely.&nbsp; There might be a slow
upraising of the level.&nbsp; It would still be a level, and there would
still be a compelling law upon one thousand that it should do the same
thing as another thousand; but that same thing might become somewhat
more intelligent.</p>
<p>When a fine actor does a fine thing, have we such a school of audience
as to merit this admirable supply to their demands?&mdash;this applause
of their understanding?&nbsp; Is there not in the whole excellent piece
of work, something all too independent of their part in the theatre?</p>
<p>If Caligula wished that mankind had but one neck for his knife, and
Byron that all womankind had but one mouth for his kiss, so the audience
has conceived that all arts should have but one mystery for its blundering,
and thus thinks itself interested in acting when it does but admire
the actor as in a drawing.</p>
<p>The time may come when a national school of dramatic audience shall
not accept artifices that could not convince the fool amongst them;
when one brilliant moment of simplicity on the one side of the footlights
shall meet a brilliant simplicity on the other.&nbsp; Which troupe,
which side, to begin?</p>
<h2>TITHONUS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It was resolved,&rdquo; said the morning paper, &ldquo;to
colour the borders of the panels and other spaces of Portland stone
with arabesques and other patterns, but that no paint should be used,
as paint would need renewing from time to time.&nbsp; The colours, therefore,&rdquo;&mdash;and
here is the passage to be noted&mdash;&ldquo;are all mixed with wax
liquefied with petroleum; and the wax surface sets as hard as marble.
. . The wax is left time to form an imperishable surface of ornament,
which would have to be cut out of the stone with a chisel if it was
desired to remove it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not, apparently, that a new surface
is formed which, by much violence and perseverance, could, years hence,
be chipped off again; but that the &ldquo;ornament&rdquo; is driven
in and incorporate, burnt in and absorbed, so that there is nothing
possible to cut away by any industry.&nbsp; In this humorous form of
ornament we are beforehand with Posterity.&nbsp; Posterity is baffled.</p>
<p>Will this victory over our sons&rsquo; sons be the last resolute
tyranny prepared by one age for the coercion, constraint, and defeat
of the future?&nbsp; To impose that compulsion has been hitherto one
of the strongest of human desires.&nbsp; It is one, doubtless, to be
outgrown by the human race; but how slowly that growth creeps onwards,
let this success in the stencilling of St Paul&rsquo;s teach us, to
our confusion.&nbsp; There is evidently a man&mdash;a group of men&mdash;happy
at this moment because it has been possible, by great ingenuity, to
force our posterity to have their cupola of St Paul&rsquo;s with the
stone mouldings stencilled and &ldquo;picked out&rdquo; with niggling
colours, whether that undefended posterity like it or not.&nbsp; And
this is a survival of one of the obscure pleasures of man, attested
by history.</p>
<p>It is impossible to read the Thirty-nine Articles, for example, and
not to recognize in those acts of final, all-resolute, eager, eternal
legislation one of the strongest of all recorded proofs of this former
human wish.&nbsp; If Galileo&rsquo;s Inquisitors put a check upon the
earth, which yet moved, a far bolder enterprise was the Reformers&rsquo;
who arrested the moving man, and inhibited the moving God.&nbsp; The
sixteenth century and a certain part of the age immediately following
seem to be times when the desire had conspicuously become a passion.&nbsp;
Say the middle of the sixteenth century in Italy and the beginning of
the seventeenth in England&mdash;for in those days we were somewhat
in the rear.&nbsp; <i>There</i> is the obstinate, confident, unreluctant,
undoubting, and resolved seizure upon power.&nbsp; <i>Then</i> was Rome
rebuilt, re-faced, marked with a single sign and style.&nbsp; Then was
many a human hand stretched forth to grasp the fate of the unborn.&nbsp;
The fortunes and the thoughts of the day to come were to be as the day
then present would have them, if the dead hand&mdash;the living hand
that was then to die, and was to keep its hold in death&mdash;could
by any means make them fast.</p>
<p>Obviously, to build at all is to impose something upon an age that
may be more than willing to build for itself.&nbsp; The day may soon
come when no man will do even so much without some impulse of apology.&nbsp;
Posterity is not compelled to keep our pictures or our books in existence,
nor to read nor to look at them; but it is more or less obliged to have
a stone building in view for an age or two.&nbsp; We can hardly avoid
some of the forms of tyranny over the future, but few, few are the living
men who would consent to share in this horrible ingenuity at St Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;this
petroleum and this wax.</p>
<p>In 1842 they were discussing the decoration of the Houses of Parliament,
and the efforts of all in council were directed upon the future.&nbsp;
How the frescoes then to be achieved by the artists of the day should
be made secure against all mischances&mdash;smoke, damp, &ldquo;the
risk of bulging,&rdquo; even accidents attending the washing of upper
floors&mdash;all was discussed in confidence with the public.&nbsp;
It was impossible for anyone who read the papers then to escape from
some at least of the responsibilities of technical knowledge.&nbsp;
From Genoa, from Rome, from Munich especially, all kinds of expert and
most deliberate schemes were gathered in order to defeat the natural
and not superfluous operation of efficient and effacing time.</p>
<p>The academic little capital of Bavaria had, at about the same date,
decorated a vast quantity of wall space of more than one order of architecture.&nbsp;
Art revived and was encouraged at that time and place with unparalleled
obstinacy.&nbsp; They had not the malice of the petroleum that does
violence to St Paul&rsquo;s; but they had instead an indomitable patience.&nbsp;
Under the commands of the master Cornelius, they baffled time and all
his work&mdash;refused his pardons, his absolutions, his cancelling
indulgences&mdash;by a perseverance that nothing could discourage.&nbsp;
Who has not known somewhat indifferent painters mighty busy about their
colours and varnishes?&nbsp; Cornelius caused a pit to be dug for the
preparation of the lime, and in the case of the Ludwig Kirche this lime
remained there for eight years, with frequent stirrings.&nbsp; This
was in order that the whole fresco, when at last it was entrusted to
its bed, should be set there for immortality.&nbsp; Nor did the master
fail to thwart time by those mechanical means that should avert the
risk of bulging already mentioned.&nbsp; He neglected no detail.&nbsp;
He was provident, and he lay in wait for more than one of the laws of
nature, to frustrate them.&nbsp; Gravitation found him prepared, and
so did the less majestic but not vain dispensation of accidents.&nbsp;
Against bulging he had an underplot of tiles set on end; against possible
trickling from an upper floor he had asphalt; it was all part of the
human conspiracy.&nbsp; In effect, the dull pictures at Munich seem
to stand well.&nbsp; It would have been more just&mdash;so the present
age thinks of these preserved walls&mdash;if the day that admired them
had had them exclusively, and our day had been exempt.&nbsp; The painted
cathedrals of the Middle Ages have undergone the natural correction;
why not the Ludwig Kirche?</p>
<p>In 1842, then, the nations were standing, as it were, shoulder to
shoulder against the walk of time and against his gentle act and art.&nbsp;
They had just called iron into their cabal.&nbsp; Cornelius came from
Munich to London, looked at the walls at Westminster, and put a heart
of confidence into the breast of the Commission.&nbsp; The situation,
he averred, need not be too damp for immortality, with due care.&nbsp;
What he had done in the Glyptothek and in the Pinacothek might be done
with the best results in England, in defiance of the weather, of the
river, of the mere days, of the divine order of alteration, and, in
a word, of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was that good servant of the law of change, lime
that had not been kept quite long enough, ready to fulfil its mission;
they would have none of it.&nbsp; They evaded it, studied its ways,
and put it to the rout.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many failures that might have been
hastily attributed to damp were really owing to the use of lime in too
fresh a state.&nbsp; Of the experimental works painted at Munich, those
only have faded which are known to have been done without due attention
to the materials.&nbsp; <i>Thus</i>, <i>a</i> <i>figure</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Bavaria</i>, <i>painted</i> <i>by</i> <i>Kaulbach</i>, <i>which</i>
<i>has</i> <i>faded</i> <i>considerably</i>, <i>is</i> <i>known</i>
<i>to</i> <i>have</i> <i>been</i> <i>executed</i> <i>with</i> <i>lime</i>
<i>that</i> <i>was</i> <i>too</i> <i>fresh</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One cannot
refrain from italics: the way was so easy; it was only to take a little
less of this important care about the lime, to have a better confidence,
to be more impatient and eager, and all had been well: <i>not</i> to
do&mdash;a virtue of omission.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of art-criticism.&nbsp; It is an ethical question
hitherto unstudied.&nbsp; The makers of laws have not always been obliged
to face it, inasmuch as their laws are made in part for the present,
and in part for that future whereof the present needs to be assured&mdash;that
is, the future is bound as a guaranty for present security of person
or property.&nbsp; Some such hold upon the time to come we are obliged
to claim, and to claim it for our own sakes&mdash;because of the reflex
effect upon our own affairs, and not for the pleasure of fettering the
time to come.&nbsp; Every maker of a will does at least this.</p>
<p>Were the men of the sixteenth century so moderate?&nbsp; Not they.&nbsp;
They found the present all too narrow for the imposition of their will.&nbsp;
It did not satisfy them to disinter and scatter the bones of the dead,
nor to efface the records of a past that offended them.&nbsp; It did
not satisfy them to bind the present to obedience by imperative menace
and instant compulsion.&nbsp; When they had burnt libraries and thrown
down monuments and pursued the rebels of the past into the other world,
and had seen to it that none living should evade them, then they outraged
the future.</p>
<p>Whatever misgivings may have visited those dominant minds as to the
effectual and final success of their measures&mdash;would their writ
run in time as well as place, and were the nameless populations indeed
their subjects?&mdash;whatever questions may have peered in upon those
rigid counsels and upon those busy vigils of the keepers of the world,
they silenced by legislation and yet more legislation.&nbsp; They wrote
in statute books; they would have written their will across the skies.&nbsp;
Their hearts would have burnt for lack of records more inveterate, and
of testimonials that mankind should lack courage to question, if in
truth they did ever doubt lest posterity might try their lock.&nbsp;
Perhaps they did never so much as foresee the race of the unnumbered
and emancipated for whom their prohibitions and penalties are no more
than documents of history.</p>
<p>If the tyrannous day of our fathers had but possessed the means of
these our more diffident times!&nbsp; They, who would have written their
present and actual will upon the skies, might certainly have written
it in petroleum and wax upon the stone.&nbsp; Fate did them wrong in
withholding from their hands this means of finality and violence.&nbsp;
Into our hands it has been given at a time when the student of the race
thought, perhaps, that we had been proved in the school of forbearance.&nbsp;
Something, indeed, we may have learnt therein, but not enough, as we
now find.</p>
<p>We have not yet the natural respect for the certain knowledge and
the probable wisdom of our successors.&nbsp; A certain reverend official
document, not guiltless of some confusion of thought, lately recommended
to the veneration of the present times &ldquo;those past ages with their
store of experience.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doubtless, as the posterity of their
predecessors our predecessors had experience, but, as our ancestors,
none&mdash;none.&nbsp; Therefore, if they were a little reverend our
own posterity is right reverend.&nbsp; It is a flippant and novelty-loving
humour that so flatters the unproved past and refuses the deference
due to the burden of years which is ours, which&mdash;grown still graver&mdash;will
be our children&rsquo;s.</p>
<h2>THE TOW PATH</h2>
<p>A childish pleasure in producing small mechanical effects unaided
must have some part in the sense of enterprise wherewith you gird your
shoulders with the tackle, and set out, alone but necessary, on the
even path of the lopped and grassy side of the Thames&mdash;the side
of meadows.</p>
<p>The elastic resistance of the line is a &ldquo;heart-animating strain,&rdquo;
only too slight; and sensible is the thrill in it as the ranks of the
riverside plants, with their small summit-flower of violet-pink, are
swept aside like a long green breaker of flourishing green.&nbsp; The
line drums lightly in the ears when the bushes are high and it grows
taut; it makes a telephone for the rush of flowers under the stress
of your easy power.</p>
<p>The active delights of one who is not athletic are few, like the
joys of &ldquo;feeling hearts&rdquo; according to the erroneous sentiment
of a verse of Moore&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The joys of sensitive hearts are
many; but the joys of sensitive hands are few.&nbsp; Here, however,
in the effectual act of towing, is the ample revenge of the unmuscular
upon the happy labourers with the oar, the pole, the bicycle, and all
other means of violence.&nbsp; Here, on the long tow-path, between warm,
embrowned meadows and opal waters, you need but to walk in your swinging
harness, and so take your friends up-stream.</p>
<p>You work merely as the mill-stream works&mdash;by simple movement.&nbsp;
At lock after lock along a hundred miles, deep-roofed mills shake to
the wheel that turns by no greater stress, and you and the river have
the same mere force of progress.</p>
<p>There never was any kinder incentive of companionship.&nbsp; It is
the bright Thames walking softly in your blood, or you that are flowing
by so many curves of low shore on the level of the world.</p>
<p>Now you are over against the shadows, and now opposite the sun, as
the wheeling river makes the sky wheel about your head and swings the
lighted clouds or the blue to face your eyes.&nbsp; The birds, flying
high for mountain air in the heat, wing nothing but their own weight.&nbsp;
You will not envy them for so brief a success.&nbsp; Did not Wordsworth
want a &ldquo;little boat&rdquo; for the air?&nbsp; Did not Byron call
him a blockhead therefor?&nbsp; Wordsworth had, perhaps, a sense of
towing.</p>
<p>All the advantage of the expert is nothing in this simple industry.&nbsp;
Even the athlete, though he may go further, cannot do better than you,
walking your effectual walk with the line attached to your willing steps.&nbsp;
Your moderate strength of a mere everyday physical education gives you
the sufficient mastery of the towpath.</p>
<p>If your natural walk is heavy, there is spirit in the tackle to give
it life, and if it is buoyant it will be more buoyant under the buoyant
burden&mdash;the yielding check&mdash;than ever before.&nbsp; An unharnessed
walk must begin to seem to you a sorry incident of insignificant liberty.&nbsp;
It is easier than towing?&nbsp; So is the drawing of water in a sieve
easier to the arms than drawing in a bucket, but not to the heart.</p>
<p>To walk unbound is to walk in prose, without the friction of the
wings of metre, without the sweet and encouraging tug upon the spirit
and the line.</p>
<p>No dead weight follows you as you tow.&nbsp; The burden is willing;
it depends upon you gaily, as a friend may do without making any depressing
show of helplessness; neither, on the other hand, is it apt to set you
at naught or charge you with a make-believe.&nbsp; It accompanies, it
almost anticipates; it lags when you are brisk, just so much as to give
your briskness good reason, and to justify you if you should take to
still more nimble heels.&nbsp; All your haste, moreover, does but waken
a more brilliantly-sounding ripple.</p>
<p>The bounding and rebounding burden you carry (but it nearly seems
to carry you, so fine is the mutual good will) gives work to your figure,
enlists your erectness and your gait, but leaves your eyes free.&nbsp;
No watching of mechanisms for the labourer of the tow-path.&nbsp; What
little outlook is to be kept falls to the lot of the steerer smoothly
towed.&nbsp; Your easy and efficient work lets you carry your head high
and watch the birds, or listen to them.&nbsp; They fly in such lofty
air that they seem to turn blue in the blue sky.&nbsp; A flash of their
flight shows silver for a moment, but they are blue birds in that sunny
distance above, as mountains are blue, and horizons.&nbsp; The days
are so still that you do not merely hear the cawing of the rooks&mdash;you
overhear their hundred private croakings and creakings, the soliloquy
of the solitary places swept by wings.</p>
<p>As for songs, it is September, and the silence of July is long at
an end.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s robins are in full voice; and the only
song that is not for love or nesting&mdash;the childish song of boy-birds,
the freshest and youngest note&mdash;is, by a happy paradox, that of
an autumnal voice.</p>
<p>Here is no hoot, nor hurry of engines, nor whisper of the cyclist&rsquo;s
wheel, nor foot upon a road, to overcome that light but resounding note.&nbsp;
Silent are feet on the grassy brink, like the innocent, stealthy soles
of the barefooted in the south.</p>
<h2>THE TETHERED CONSTELLATIONS</h2>
<p>It is no small thing&mdash;no light discovery&mdash;to find a river
Andromeda and Arcturus and their bright neighbours wheeling for half
a summer night around a pole-star in the waters.&nbsp; One star or two&mdash;delicate
visitants of streams&mdash;we are used to see, somewhat by a sleight
of the eyes, so fine and so fleeting is that apparition.&nbsp; Or the
southern waves may show the light&mdash;not the image&mdash;of the evening
or the morning planet.&nbsp; But this, in a pool of the country Thames
at night, is no ripple-lengthened light; it is the startling image of
a whole large constellation burning in the flood.</p>
<p>These reflected heavens are different heavens.&nbsp; On a darker
and more vacant field than that of the real skies, the shape of the
Lyre or the Bear has an altogether new and noble solitude; and the waters
play a painter&rsquo;s part in setting their splendid subject free.&nbsp;
Two movements shake but do not scatter the still night: the bright flashing
of constellations in the deep Weir-pool, and the dark flashes of the
vague bats flying.&nbsp; The stars in the stream fluctuate with an alien
motion.&nbsp; Reversed, estranged, isolated, every shape of large stars
escapes and returns, escapes and returns.&nbsp; Fitful in the steady
night, those constellations, so few, so whole, and so remote, have a
suddenness of gleaming life.&nbsp; You imagine that some unexampled
gale might make them seem to shine with such a movement in the veritable
sky; yet nothing but deep water, seeming still in its incessant flight
and rebound, could really show such altered stars.&nbsp; The flood lets
a constellation fly, as Juliet&rsquo;s &ldquo;wanton&rdquo; with a tethered
bird, only to pluck it home again.&nbsp; At moments some rhythmic flux
of the water seems about to leave the darkly-set, widely-spaced Bear
absolutely at large, to dismiss the great stars, and refuse to imitate
the skies, and all the water is obscure; then one broken star returns,
then fragments of another, and a third and a fourth flit back to their
noble places, brilliantly vague, wonderfully visible, mobile, and unalterable.&nbsp;
There is nothing else at once so keen and so elusive.</p>
<p>The aspen poplar had been in captive flight all day, but with no
such vanishings as these.&nbsp; The dimmer constellations of the soft
night are reserved by the skies.&nbsp; Hardly is a secondary star seen
by the large and vague eyes of the stream.&nbsp; They are blind to the
Pleiades.</p>
<p>There is a little kind of star that drowns itself by hundreds in
the river Thames&mdash;the many-rayed silver-white seed that makes journeys
on all the winds up and down England and across it in the end of summer.&nbsp;
It is a most expert traveller, turning a little wheel a-tiptoe wherever
the wind lets it rest, and speeding on those pretty points when it is
not flying.&nbsp; The streets of London are among its many highways,
for it is fragile enough to go far in all sorts of weather.&nbsp; But
it gets disabled if a rough gust tumbles it on the water so that its
finely-feathered feet are wet.&nbsp; On gentle breezes it is able to
cross dry-shod, walking the waters.</p>
<p>All unlike is this pilgrim star to the tethered constellations.&nbsp;
It is far adrift.&nbsp; It goes singly to all the winds.&nbsp; It offers
thistle plants (or whatever is the flower that makes such delicate ashes)
to the tops of many thousand hills.&nbsp; Doubtless the farmer would
rather have to meet it in battalions than in these invincible units
astray.&nbsp; But if the farmer owes it a lawful grudge, there is many
a rigid riverside garden wherein it would be a great pleasure to sow
the thistles of the nearest pasture.</p>
<h2>POPULAR BURLESQUE</h2>
<p>The more I consider that strange inversion of idolatry which is the
motive of Guy Fawkes Day and which annually animates the by-streets
with the sound of processionals and of recessionals&mdash;a certain
popular version of &ldquo;Lest we forget&rdquo; their unvaried theme;
the more I hear the cries of derision raised by the makers of this likeness
of something unworshipful on the earth beneath, so much the more am
I convinced that the national humour is that of banter, and that no
other kind of mirth so gains as does this upon the public taste.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is the popular idea of a street festival; that
day is as the people will actually have it, with their own invention,
their own material, their own means, and their own spirit.&nbsp; They
owe nothing on this occasion to the promptings or the subscriptions
of the classes that are apt to take upon themselves the direction and
tutelage of the people in relation to any form of art.&nbsp; Here on
every fifth of November the people have their own way with their own
art; and their way is to offer the service of the image-maker, reversed
in hissing and irony, to some creature of their hands.</p>
<p>It is a wanton fancy; and perhaps no really barbarous people is capable
of so overturning the innocent plan of original portraiture.&nbsp; To
make a mental image of all things that are named to the ear, or conceived
in the mind, being an industrious custom of children and childish people
which lapses in the age of much idle reading, the making of a material
image is the still more diligent and more sedulous act, whereby the
primitive man controls and caresses his own fancy.&nbsp; He may take
arms anon, disappointed, against his own work; but did he ever do that
work in malice from the outset?</p>
<p>From the statue to the doll, images are all outraged in the person
of the guy.&nbsp; If it were but an antithesis to the citizen&rsquo;s
idea of something admirable which he might carry in procession on some
other day, the carrying of the guy would be less gloomy; but he would
hoot at a suspicion that he might admire anything so much as to make
a good-looking doll in its praise.&nbsp; There is absolutely no image-making
art in the practice of our people, except only this art of rags and
contumely.&nbsp; Or, again, if the revenge taken upon a guy were that
of anger for a certain cause, the destruction would not be the work
of so thin an annual malice and of so heartless a rancour.</p>
<p>But the single motive is that popular irony which becomes daily&mdash;or
so it seems&mdash;more and more the holiday temper of the majority.&nbsp;
Mockery is the only animating impulse, and a loud incredulity is the
only intelligence.&nbsp; They make an image of some one in whom they
do not believe, to deride it.&nbsp; Say that the guy is the effigy of
an agitator in the cause of something to be desired; the street man
and boy have then two motives of mocking: they think the reform to be
not worth doing, and they are willing to suspect the reformer of some
kind of hypocrisy.&nbsp; Perhaps the guy of this occasion is most characteristic
of all guys in London.&nbsp; The people, having him or her to deride,
do not even wait for the opportunity of their annual procession.&nbsp;
They anticipate time, and make an image when it is not November, and
sell it at the market of the kerb.</p>
<p>Hear, moreover, the songs which some nameless one makes for the citizens,
perhaps in thoughtful renunciation of the making of their laws.&nbsp;
These, too, seem to have for their inspiration the universal taunt.&nbsp;
They are, indeed, most in vogue when they have no meaning at all&mdash;this
it is that makes the <i>succ&egrave;s</i> <i>fou</i> (and here Paris
is of one mind with London) of the street; but short of such a triumph,
and when a meaning is discernible, it is an irony.</p>
<p>Bank Holiday courtship (if the inappropriate word can be pardoned)
seems to be done, in real life, entirely by banter.&nbsp; And it is
the strangest thing to find that the banter of women by men is the most
mocking in the exchange.&nbsp; If the burlesque of the maid&rsquo;s
tongue is provocative, that of the man&rsquo;s is derisive.&nbsp; Somewhat
of the order of things as they stood before they were inverted seems
to remain, nevertheless, as a memory; nay, to give the inversion a kind
of lagging interest.&nbsp; Irony is made more complete by the remembrance,
and by an implicit allusion to the state of courtship in other classes,
countries, or times.&nbsp; Such an allusion no doubt gives all its peculiar
twang to the burlesque of love.</p>
<p>With the most strange submission these Englishwomen in their millions
undergo all degrees of derision from the tongues of men who are their
mates, equals, contemporaries, perhaps in some obscure sense their suitors,
and in a strolling manner, with one knows not what ungainly motive of
reserve, even their admirers.&nbsp; Nor from their tongues only; for,
to pass the time, the holiday swain annoys the girl; and if he wears
her hat, it is ten to one that he has plucked it off with a humorous
disregard of her dreadful pins.</p>
<p>We have to believe that unmocked love has existence in the streets,
because of the proof that is published when a man shoots a woman who
has rejected him; and from this also do we learn to believe that a woman
of the burlesque classes is able to reject.&nbsp; But for that sign
we should find little or nothing intelligible in what we see or overhear
of the drama of love in popular life.</p>
<p>In its easy moments, in its leisure, at holiday time, it baffles
all tradition, and shows us the spirit of comedy clowning after a fashion
that is insular and not merely civic.&nbsp; You hear the same twang
in country places; and whether the English maid, having, like the antique,
thrown her apple at her shepherd, run into the thickets of Hampstead
Heath or among sylvan trees, it seems that the most humorous thing to
be done by the swain would be, in the opinion in vogue, to stroll another
way.&nbsp; Insular I have said, because I have not seen the like of
this fashion whether in America or elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>But the chief inversion of all, proved summarily by the annual inversion
of the worship of images on the fifth of November, is that of a sentence
of Wordsworth&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;We live by admiration.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>DRY AUTUMN</h2>
<p>One who has much and often protested against the season of Autumn,
her pathos, her chilly breakfast-time, her &ldquo;tints,&rdquo; her
decay, and her extraordinary popularity, saw cause one year to make
a partial recantation.&nbsp; Autumn, until then, had seemed to be a
practitioner of all the easy arts at once, or rather, she had taken
the easy way with the arts of colour, sentiment, suggestion, and regret.</p>
<p>She had often encouraged and rewarded, also, the ingratitude of a
whole nation for a splendid summer, somewhat officiously cooling, refreshing,
allaying, and comforting the discontent of the victims of an English
sun.&nbsp; She had soothed the fuming citizen, and brought back the
fogs of custom, effaced the skies, to which he had upturned no very
attentive eye, muffled up his chin, and in many other ways curried favour.&nbsp;
Not only did she fall in with his landscape mood, but she made herself
his housemate by his fireplaces, drew his curtains, shut out her own
wet winds in the streets, and became privy to the commoner comforts
of man, like a wild creature tamed and conniving at human sport and
schemes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Domesticated&rdquo; Gothic itself, or the governesses
who daily by advertisement describe themselves by that same strange
modern adjective, could not be more bent upon the flattery of man in
his less heroic moments.</p>
<p>Autumn, for all her show of stormy woods, is apt to be the accomplice
of daily human things that lack dignity, and are, in the now accepted
sense of a once noble word, comfortable.&nbsp; Besides, her show of
stormy forests is done with an abandonment to the pathos of the moment,
with dashings and underlinings&mdash;we all know the sort of letter,
for instance, which answers to the message and proclamation of Autumn,
as she usually is in the outer world.&nbsp; A complete sentimentalist
is she, whether in the open country or when she looks in at the lighted
windows, and goodnaturedly makes her voice like a very goblin&rsquo;s
outside, for the increasing of the bourgeois&rsquo; <i>bien</i>-<i>&ecirc;tre</i>.</p>
<p>But that year all had been otherwise.&nbsp; Autumn had borne herself
with a heroism of sunny weather.&nbsp; Where we had been wont to see
signals of distress, and to hear the voluble outpouring of an excitable
temperament, with the extremity of scattered leaves and desperate damp,
we beheld an aspect of golden drought.&nbsp; Nothing mouldered&mdash;everything
was consumed by vital fires.&nbsp; The gardens were strewn with smouldering
soft ashes of late roses, late honeysuckle, honey-sweet clematis.&nbsp;
The silver seeds of rows of riverside flowers took sail on their random
journey with a light wind.&nbsp; Leaves set forth, a few at a time,
with a little volley of birds&mdash;a buoyant caravel.&nbsp; Or, in
the stiller weather, the infrequent fall of leaves took place quietly,
with no proclamation of ruin, in the privacy within the branches.&nbsp;
While nearly all the woods were still fresh as streams, you might see
that here or there was one, with an invincible summer smile, slowly
consuming, in defiance of decay.&nbsp; Life destroyed that autumn, not
death.</p>
<p>The novelist would be at a loss had we a number of such years.&nbsp;
He would lose the easiest landscape&mdash;for the autumn has among her
facile ways the way of allowing herself to be described by rote.&nbsp;
But there were no regions of crimson woods and yellow&mdash;only the
grave, cool, and cheerful green of the health of summer, and now and
then that deep bronzing of the leaves that the sun brought to pass.&nbsp;
Never did apples look better than in those still vigorous orchards.&nbsp;
They shone so that lamps would hardly be brighter.&nbsp; The apple-gathering,
under such a sun, was nearly as warm and brilliant as a vintage; and
indeed it was of the Italian autumn that you were reminded.&nbsp; There
were the same sunburnt tones, the same brown health.&nbsp; There was
the dark smile of chestnut woods as among the Apennines.</p>
<p>For it was chiefly within the woods that the splendid autumn without
pathos gave delight.&nbsp; The autumn <i>with</i> pathos has a way there
of overwhelming her many fragrances in the general odour of dead leaves
generalized.&nbsp; That year you could breathe all the several sweet
scents, as discriminated and distinct as those of flowers on the tops
of mountains&mdash;warm pine and beech as different as thyme and broom,
unconfused.&nbsp; Even the Spring, with her little divided breezes of
hawthorn, rose, and lilac, was not more various.</p>
<p>Moreover, while some of the woods were green, none of the fields
were so.&nbsp; In their sunburnt colours were to be seen &ldquo;autumn
tints&rdquo; of a far different beauty from that of a gaudy decay.&nbsp;
Dry autumn is a general lover of simplicity, and she sweeps a landscape
with long plain colours that take their variations from the light.&nbsp;
When the country looks &ldquo;burnt up,&rdquo; as they say who are ungrateful
for the sun, then are these colours most tender.&nbsp; Grass, that had
lost its delicacy in the day when the last hay was carried, gets it
again.&nbsp; For a little time it was&mdash;new-reaped&mdash;of something
too hard a green; then came dry autumn along, and softened it into a
hundred exquisite browns.&nbsp; Dry autumn does beautiful things in
sepia, as the water-colour artist did in the early days, and draws divine
brown Turners of the first manner.</p>
<p>The fields and hedgerows must needs fade, and the sun made the fading
quick with the bloom of brown.&nbsp; For one great meadow so softly
gilded, I would give all the scarlet and yellow trees that ever made
a steaming autumn gorgeous&mdash;all the crimson of the Rhine valleys,
all the patched and spotted walnut-leaves of the <i>m&uuml;hl</i>-<i>thal</i>
by Boppard, and the little trees that change so suddenly to their yellow
of decay in groups at the foot of the ruins of Sternberg and Liebenstein,
every one of their branches disguised in the same bright, insignificant,
unhopeful colour.</p>
<p>An autumn so rare should not close without a recorded &ldquo;hail
and farewell!&rdquo;&nbsp; Spring was not braver, summer was not sweeter.&nbsp;
That year&rsquo;s great sun called upon a great spirit in all the riverside
woods.&nbsp; Those woods did not grow cold; they yielded to their last
sunset.</p>
<h2>THE PLAID</h2>
<p>It is disconcerting to hear of the plaid in India.&nbsp; Our dyes,
we know, they use in the silk mills of Bombay, with the deplorable result
that their old clothes are dull and unintentionally falsified with infelicitous
decay.&nbsp; The Hindus are a washing people; and the sun and water
that do but dim, soften, and warm the native vegetable dyes to the last,
do but burlesque the aniline.&nbsp; Magenta is bad enough when it is
itself; but the worst of magenta is that it spoils but poorly.&nbsp;
No bad modern forms and no bad modern colours spoil well.&nbsp; And
spoiling is an important process.&nbsp; It is a test&mdash;one of the
ironical tests that come too late with their proofs.&nbsp; London portico-houses
will make some such ruins as do chemical dyes, which undergo no use
but derides them, no accidents but caricature them.&nbsp; This is an
old enough grievance.&nbsp; But the plaid!</p>
<p>The plaid is the Scotchman&rsquo;s contribution to the decorative
art of the world.&nbsp; Scotland has no other indigenous decoration.&nbsp;
In his most admirable lecture on &ldquo;The Two Paths,&rdquo; Ruskin
acknowledged, with a passing misgiving, that his Highlanders had little
art.&nbsp; And the misgiving was but passing, because he considered
how fatally wrong was the art of India&mdash;&ldquo;it never represents
a natural fact.&nbsp; It forms its compositions out of meaningless fragments
of colour and flowings of line . . . It will not draw a man, but an
eight-armed monster; it will not draw a flower, but only a spiral or
a zig-zag.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because of this aversion from Nature the Hindu
and his art tended to evil, we read.&nbsp; But of the Scot we are told,
&ldquo;You will find upon reflection that all the highest points of
the Scottish character are connected with impressions derived straight
from the natural scenery of their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What, then, about the plaid?&nbsp; Where is the natural fact there?&nbsp;
If the Indian, by practising a non-natural art of spirals and zig-zags,
cuts himself off &ldquo;from all possible sources of healthy knowledge
or natural delight,&rdquo; to what did the good and healthy Highlander
condemn himself by practising the art of the plaid?&nbsp; A spiral may
be found in the vine, and a zig-zag in the lightning, but where in nature
is the plaid to be found?&nbsp; There is surely no curve or curl that
can be drawn by a designing hand but is a play upon some infinitely
various natural fact.&nbsp; The smoke of the cigarette, more sensitive
in motion than breath or blood, has its waves so multitudinously inflected
and reinflected, with such flights and such delays, it flows and bends
upon currents of so subtle influence and impulse as to include the most
active, impetuous, and lingering curls ever drawn by the finest Oriental
hand&mdash;and that is not a Hindu hand, nor any hand of Aryan race.&nbsp;
The Japanese has captured the curve of the section of a sea-wave&mdash;its
flow, relaxation, and fall; but this is a single movement, whereas the
line of cigarette-smoke in a still room fluctuates in twenty delicate
directions.&nbsp; No, it is impossible to accept the saying that the
poor spiral or scroll of a human design is anything but a participation
in the innumerable curves and curls of nature.</p>
<p>Now the plaid is not only &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; from natural sources,
as Ruskin says of Oriental design&mdash;the plaid is not only cut off
from nature, and cut off from nature by the yard, for it is to be measured
off in inorganic quantity; but it is even a kind of intentional contradiction
of all natural or vital forms.&nbsp; And it is equally defiant of vital
tone and of vital colour.&nbsp; Everywhere in nature tone is gradual,
and between the fainting of a tone and the failing of a curve there
is a charming analogy.&nbsp; But the tartan insists that its tone shall
be invariable, and sharply defined by contrasts of dark and light.&nbsp;
As to colour, it has colours, not colour.</p>
<p>But that plaid should now go so far afield as to decorate the noble
garment of the Indies is ill news.&nbsp; True, Ruskin saw nothing but
cruelty and corruption in Indian life or art; but let us hear an Indian
maxim in regard to those who, in cruel places, are ready sufferers:
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; says the <i>Mahabharata</i>, &ldquo;where women
are treated with respect, the very gods are said to be filled with joy.&nbsp;
Women deserve to be honoured.&nbsp; Serve ye them.&nbsp; Bend your will
before them.&nbsp; By honouring women ye are sure to attain to the fruition
of all things.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the rash teachers of our youth would
have persuaded us that this generous lesson was first learnt in Teutonic
forests!</p>
<p>Nothing but extreme lowliness can well reply, or would probably be
suffered to reply, to this Hindu profession of reverence.&nbsp; Accordingly
the woman so honoured makes an offering of cakes and oil to the souls
of her mother-in-law, grandmother-in-law, and great-grandmother-in-law,
in gratitude for their giving her a good husband.&nbsp; And to go back
for a moment to Ruskin&rsquo;s contrast of the two races, it was assuredly
under the stress of some too rash reasoning that he judged the lovely
art of the East as a ministrant to superstition, cruelty, and pleasure,
whether wrought upon the temple, the sword, or the girdle.&nbsp; The
innocent art of innocent Hindu women for centuries decked their most
modest heads, their dedicated and sequestered beauty, their child-loving
breasts, and consecrated chambers.</p>
<h2>TWO BURDENS</h2>
<p>One is on the breast and clings there with arms, and one on the back
and clings with thongs.&nbsp; The burden of the back bows the body,
turns the face from the sky, narrows the lungs and flattens the foot;
takes away the flight and the dance from the gait of man, and ties him
towards the earth&mdash;not only in the way of nature, by means of his
arched feet, but by a heavy lien upon his shoulders and his brows.&nbsp;
It is the fardel that makes this vital figure to be subject visibly,
and at several points, to that law of gravitation which, in a state
of liberty, it uses to withstand, to countervail, to leap from, to walk
with, making the universal tether elastic.&nbsp; Bend in two this supple
spine that can lift itself, like a snake erect, with something better
than mere balance&mdash;with life and the active will; bend the back,
and at once gravitation takes hold of the loins and grasps the knees,
and pulls upon the shoulders, and the neck feels the weight of an abject
head.</p>
<p>Wherever women are told off to hard open-air labour, we shall find
among them a lower class of their own kind&mdash;poorer where all are
poor, and straining at their task where all are labouring&mdash;who
walk the dust with burdens on their backs.&nbsp; Loads of field-labour
are these, or of the labour in a fishing-port, and large in proportion
to their weight; too large to be bound close and carried on the head,
too wide to be borne on the shoulder, too unwieldy for the clasp of
arms.&nbsp; Among American Indians, we are told, the women carry the
tent so, and the gear of a <i>d&egrave;m&egrave;nagement</i>, and the
warrior himself, upon his goods, not seldom.&nbsp; In the agriculture
of the European Continent the women carry the large loads thus, the
refuse is laid upon them, and all that is bound up for burning; they
are the gleaners, not of wheat but of tares.&nbsp; Or they carry fodder
for the imprisoned cattle, disappearing as they walk, bowed, quenched,
hooded, and hidden with hay.</p>
<p>Women who bear this load do not prosper.&nbsp; They have a downward
look, albeit not as conspirators; and in them the earth carries a burden
like their own, or but little more buoyant.&nbsp; Stones off the face
of the stony fields, huge sheaves of stalks and husks after granaries
are filled, fuel and forage&mdash;bent from the stature of women, those
who bear those bundles go near the earth that gave them, and breathe
her dust.</p>
<p>In Austria, where women carry the hod and climb the ladder; in the
Rhineland, where a cart goes along the valley roads drawn by a woman
harnessed with a cow&mdash;even here I think the hardship hardly so
great as where the burden is laid upon the bent back of her whose arms
are too small or too weak to grasp it; for after long use in such carrying,
the figure is no longer fit for habitual erection.&nbsp; And the use
is established with those women who are so loaded.&nbsp; It is not that
all the labouring women of such a village or such a sea-port are burdened
in their turn with the burden of the back; it is rather that a class
is formed, a class of the burdened and the bent; and to that class belong
all ages; child-bearing women are in that sisterhood.&nbsp; No stronger
women can be seen than the upright women of Boulogne; to whom then,
but the bent, are due the many cripples, the many dwarfs, the ill-boned
stragglers of that vigorous population, the many children growing awry,
the many old people shuffling towards misshapen graves?</p>
<p>There is manifestly another burden, familiar and accustomed to the
figure of woman.&nbsp; This does not bend her back, nor withdraw her
eyes from the distance, nor rank her with the haggard waste of fields.&nbsp;
It is borne in front, and she breasts the world with it; shoulder-high,
and it is her ballast.&nbsp; So loaded she stands like the Dresden Raphael,
and there is no bearer of sword and buckler more erect.</p>
<p>It is, by the way, a curious sign of indignity of race&mdash;or,
if not indignity, provincialism&mdash;in the more extremely Oriental
people, that a Japanese woman carries her child on her back and not
upon her arm.&nbsp; It is a charming infant, and the mother looks no
more than a gentle child; with the little creature bound to her back
she carries a soft lantern in a mild blue night.&nbsp; She is not of
a classic race, and she shuffles on her subordinate way, an irresponsible
creature, who must not proffer opinions except by way of quotation,
and is scarcely of the inches that measure the landscape or of the aspect
that fronts the sky.</p>
<p>But whence is this now prevalent desire to slip the nobler and bear
the ignobler burden?&nbsp; It is not long since an American woman wrote
a book, <i>Women</i> <i>and</i> <i>Economics</i>, urging equal labour
upon women, by the analogy of animals that know no distinction between
a strong sex and a weak, nor between a free sex and one confined to
the pen, or the lair, or the cover, by the care of little ones.&nbsp;
The reply seems too obvious that the children of men are more helpless,
and are helpless for a longer time, even in proportion to their longer
life, than the off-spring of other living creatures.&nbsp; The children
of men have to be carried.&nbsp; This author complains that women are
economically dependent upon men; and she finds that the world has &ldquo;misty
ideas upon the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; If those misty ideas are to the
effect that a woman who keeps house for the service of herself, her
husband, and the other inmates, gives her work in return for maintenance,
and is not a dependent but a colleague, I must wish that ideas &ldquo;mistily&rdquo;
held were often so just, and ideas vaguely believed were often so well
founded.&nbsp; Those who charge the husband with &ldquo;employing&rdquo;
his wife choose to neglect the fact that she is mistress and hostess,
as well as &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or &ldquo;housekeeper,&rdquo; ministering
to herself and to the guests in whose company she has pleasure, and
to whose respect she has a right.&nbsp; Our economic author proceeds:
&ldquo;We are the only animal species in which the sex relation is also
an economic factor. . . We have not been accustomed to face this fact
beyond our loose generalization that it was &lsquo;natural,&rsquo; and
that other animals did so too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Has anyone really been so
rash as to aver &ldquo;that other animals did so too&rdquo;?&nbsp; The
obvious truth is that other animals do otherwise, but that, whatever
they do, they make no rule or example for man.&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;Whatever
the economic value of the domestic industry of women is, they do not
get it.&nbsp; The women who do the most work get the least money.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And yet but now they were charged with &ldquo;getting it&rdquo; too
dependently, or rather, with having it &ldquo;got&rdquo; for them by
man!&nbsp; Is this writer indeed misled by that mere word &ldquo;money,&rdquo;
which she here lets slip?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He nearly persuades me to go on all fours,&rdquo; sighs Voltaire
rising&mdash;rising erect reluctantly, one may almost say&mdash;from
the reading of Rousseau.</p>
<h2>THE UNREADY</h2>
<p>It is rashly said that the senses of children are quick.&nbsp; They
are, on the contrary, unwieldy in turning, unready in reporting, until
advancing age teaches them agility.&nbsp; This is not lack of sensitiveness,
but mere length of process.&nbsp; For instance, a child nearly newly
born is cruelly startled by a sudden crash in the room&mdash;a child
who has never learnt to fear, and is merely overcome by the shock of
sound; nevertheless, that shock of sound does not reach the conscious
hearing or the nerves but after some moments, nor before some moments
more is the sense of the shock expressed.&nbsp; The sound travels to
the remoteness and seclusion of the child&rsquo;s consciousness, as
the roar of a gun travels to listeners half a mile away.</p>
<p>So it is, too, with pain, which has learnt to be so instant and eager
with us of later age that no point of time is lost in its touches&mdash;direct
as the unintercepted message of great and candid eyes, unhampered by
trivialities; even so immediate is the communication of pain.&nbsp;
But you could count five between the prick of a surgeon&rsquo;s instrument
upon a baby&rsquo;s arm and the little whimper that answers it.&nbsp;
The child is then too young, also, to refer the feeling of pain to the
arm that suffers it.&nbsp; Even when pain has groped its way to his
mind it hardly seems to bring local tidings thither.&nbsp; The baby
does not turn his eyes in any degree towards his arm or towards the
side that is so vexed with vaccination.&nbsp; He looks in any other
direction at haphazard, and cries at random.</p>
<p>See, too, how slowly the unpractised apprehension of an older child
trudges after the nimbleness of a conjurer.&nbsp; It is the greatest
failure to take these little <i>gobe</i>-<i>mouches</i> to a good conjurer.&nbsp;
His successes leave them cold, for they had not yet understood what
it was the good man meant to surprise them withal.&nbsp; The amateur
it is who really astonishes them.&nbsp; They cannot come up even with
your amateur beginner, performing at close quarters; whereas the master
of his craft on a platform runs quite away at the outset from the lagging
senses of his honest audience.</p>
<p>You may rob a child of his dearest plate at table, almost from under
his ingenuous eyes, send him off in chase of it, and have it in its
place and off again ten times before the little breathless boy has begun
to perceive in what direction his sweets have been snatched.</p>
<p>Teachers of young children should therefore teach themselves a habit
of awaiting, should surround themselves with pauses of patience.&nbsp;
The simple little processes of logic that arrange the grammar of a common
sentence are too quick for these young blunderers, who cannot use two
pronouns but they must confuse them.&nbsp; I never found that a young
child&mdash;one of something under nine years&mdash;was able to say,
&ldquo;I send them my love&rdquo; at the first attempt.&nbsp; It will
be &ldquo;I send me my love,&rdquo; &ldquo;I send them their love,&rdquo;
&ldquo;They send me my love&rdquo;; not, of course, through any confusion
of understanding, but because of the tardy setting of words in order
with the thoughts.&nbsp; The child visibly grapples with the difficulty,
and is beaten.</p>
<p>It is no doubt this unreadiness that causes little children to like
twice-told tales and foregone conclusions in their games.&nbsp; They
are not eager, for a year or two yet to come, for surprises.&nbsp; If
you hide and they cannot see you hiding, their joy in finding you is
comparatively small; but let them know perfectly well what cupboard
you are in, and they will find you with shouts of discovery.&nbsp; The
better the hiding-place is understood between you the more lively the
drama.&nbsp; They make a convention of art for their play.&nbsp; The
younger the children the more dramatic; and when the house is filled
with outcries of laughter from the breathless breast of a child, it
is that he is pretending to be surprised at finding his mother where
he bade her pretend to hide.&nbsp; This is the comedy that never tires.&nbsp;
Let the elder who cannot understand its charm beware how he tries to
put a more intelligible form of delight in the place of it; for, if
not, he will find that children also have a manner of substitution,
and that they will put half-hearted laughter in the place of their natural
impetuous clamours.&nbsp; It is certain that very young children like
to play upon their own imaginations, and enjoy their own short game.</p>
<p>There is something so purely childlike in the delays of a child that
any exercise asking for the swift apprehension of later life, for the
flashes of understanding and action, from the mind and members of childhood,
is no pleasure to see.&nbsp; The piano, for instance, as experts understand
it, and even as the moderately-trained may play it, claims all the immediate
action, the instantaneousness, most unnatural to childhood.&nbsp; There
may possibly be feats of skill to which young children could be trained
without this specific violence directed upon the thing characteristic
of their age&mdash;their unreadiness&mdash;but virtuosity at the piano
cannot be one of them.&nbsp; It is no delight, indeed, to see the shyness
of children, or anything that is theirs, conquered and beaten; but their
poor little slowness is so distinctively their own, and must needs be
physiologically so proper to their years, so much a natural condition
of the age of their brain, that of all childishnesses it is the one
that the world should have the patience to attend upon, the humanity
to foster, and the intelligence to understand.</p>
<p>It is true that the movements of young children are quick, but a
very little attention would prove how many apparent disconnexions there
are between the lively motion and the first impulse; it is not the brain
that is quick.&nbsp; If, on a voyage in space, electricity takes thus
much time, and light thus much, and sound thus much, there is one little
jogging traveller that would arrive after the others had forgotten their
journey, and this is the perception of a child.&nbsp; Surely our own
memories might serve to remind us how in our childhood we inevitably
missed the principal point in any procession or pageant intended by
our elders to furnish us with a historical remembrance for the future.&nbsp;
It was not our mere vagueness of understanding, it was the unwieldiness
of our senses, of our reply to the suddenness of the grown up.&nbsp;
We lived through the important moments of the passing of an Emperor
at a different rate from theirs; we stared long in the wake of his Majesty,
and of anything else of interest; every flash of movement, that got
telegraphic answers from our parents&rsquo; eyes, left us stragglers.&nbsp;
We fell out of all ranks.&nbsp; Among the sights proposed for our instruction,
that which befitted us best was an eclipse of the moon, done at leisure.&nbsp;
In good time we found the moon in the sky, in good time the eclipse
set in and made reasonable progress; we kept up with everything.</p>
<p>It is too often required of children that they should adjust themselves
to the world, practised and alert.&nbsp; But it would be more to the
purpose that the world should adjust itself to children in all its dealings
with them.&nbsp; Those who run and keep together have to run at the
pace of the tardiest.&nbsp; But we are apt to command instant obedience,
stripped of the little pauses that a child, while very young, cannot
act without.&nbsp; It is not a child of ten or twelve that needs them
so; it is the young creature who has but lately ceased to be a baby,
slow to be startled.</p>
<p>We have but to consider all that it implies of the loitering of senses
and of an unprepared consciousness&mdash;this capacity for receiving
a great shock from a noise and this perception of the shock after two
or three appreciable moments&mdash;if we would know anything of the
moments of a baby</p>
<p>Even as we must learn that our time, when it is long, is too long
for children, so must we learn that our time, when it is short, is too
short for them.&nbsp; When it is exceedingly short they cannot, without
an unnatural effort, have any perception of it.&nbsp; When children
do not see the jokes of the elderly, and disappoint expectation in other
ways, only less intimate, the reason is almost always there.&nbsp; The
child cannot turn in mid-career; he goes fast, but the impetus took
place moments ago.</p>
<h2>THE CHILD OF TUMULT</h2>
<p>A poppy bud, packed into tight bundles by so hard and resolute a
hand that the petals of the flower never afterwards lose the creases,
is a type of the child.&nbsp; Nothing but the unfolding, which is as
yet in the non-existing future, can explain the manner of the close
folding of character.&nbsp; In both flower and child it looks much as
though the process had been the reverse of what it was&mdash;as though
a finished and open thing had been folded up into the bud&mdash;so plainly
and certainly is the future implied, and the intention of compressing
and folding-close made manifest.</p>
<p>With the other incidents of childish character, the crowd of impulses
called &ldquo;naughtiness&rdquo; is perfectly perceptible&mdash;it would
seem heartless to say how soon.&nbsp; The naughty child (who is often
an angel of tenderness and charm, affectionate beyond the capacity of
his fellows, and a very ascetic of penitence when the time comes) opens
early his brief campaigns and raises the standard of revolt as soon
as he is capable of the desperate joys of disobedience.</p>
<p>But even the naughty child is an individual, and must not be treated
in the mass.&nbsp; He is numerous indeed, but not general, and to describe
him you must take the unit, with all his incidents and his organic qualities
as they are.&nbsp; Take then, for instance, one naughty child in the
reality of his life.&nbsp; He is but six years old, slender and masculine,
and not wronged by long hair, curls, or effeminate dress.&nbsp; His
face is delicate and too often haggard with tears of penitence that
Justice herself would be glad to spare him.&nbsp; Some beauty he has,
and his mouth especially is so lovely as to seem not only angelic but
itself an angel.&nbsp; He has absolutely no self-control and his passions
find him without defence.&nbsp; They come upon him in the midst of his
usual brilliant gaiety and cut short the frolic comedy of his fine spirits.</p>
<p>Then for a wild hour he is the enemy of the laws.&nbsp; If you imprison
him, you may hear his resounding voice as he takes a running kick at
the door, shouting his justification in unconquerable rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
good now!&rdquo; is made as emphatic as a shot by the blow of his heel
upon the panel.&nbsp; But if the moment of forgiveness is deferred,
in the hope of a more promising repentance, it is only too likely that
he will betake himself to a hostile silence and use all the revenge
yet known to his imagination.&nbsp; &ldquo;Darling mother, open the
door!&rdquo; cries his touching voice at last; but if the answer should
be &ldquo;I must leave you for a short time, for punishment,&rdquo;
the storm suddenly thunders again.&nbsp; &ldquo;There (crash!) I have
broken a plate, and I&rsquo;m glad it is broken into such little pieces
that you can&rsquo;t mend it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to break the &rsquo;lectric
light.&rdquo;&nbsp; When things are at this pass there is one way, and
only one, to bring the child to an overwhelming change of mind; but
it is a way that would be cruel, used more than twice or thrice in his
whole career of tempest and defiance.&nbsp; This is to let him see that
his mother is troubled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t cry!&nbsp; Oh,
don&rsquo;t be sad!&rdquo; he roars, unable still to deal with his own
passionate anger, which is still dealing with him.&nbsp; With his kicks
of rage he suddenly mingles a dance of apprehension lest his mother
should have tears in her eyes.&nbsp; Even while he is still explicitly
impenitent and defiant he tries to pull her round to the light that
he may see her face.&nbsp; It is but a moment before the other passion
of remorse comes to make havoc of the helpless child, and the first
passion of anger is quelled outright.</p>
<p>Only to a trivial eye is there nothing tragic in the sight of these
great passions within the small frame, the small will, and, in a word,
the small nature.&nbsp; When a large and sombre fate befalls a little
nature, and the stage is too narrow for the action of a tragedy, the
disproportion has sometimes made a mute and unexpressed history of actual
life or sometimes a famous book; it is the manifest core of George Eliot&rsquo;s
story of <i>Adam</i> <i>Bede</i>, where the suffering of Hetty is, as
it were, the eye of the storm.&nbsp; All is expressive around her, but
she is hardly articulate; the book is full of words&mdash;preachings,
speeches, daily talk, aphorisms, but a space of silence remains about
her in the midst of the story.&nbsp; And the disproportion of passion&mdash;the
inner disproportion&mdash;is at least as tragic as that disproportion
of fate and action; it is less intelligible, and leads into the intricacies
of nature which are more difficult than the turn of events.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that this passionate play is acted within the narrow
limits of a child&rsquo;s nature far oftener than in those of an adult
and finally formed nature.&nbsp; And this, evidently, because there
is unequal force at work within a child, unequal growth and a jostling
of powers and energies that are hurrying to their development and pressing
for exercise and life.&nbsp; It is this helpless inequality&mdash;this
untimeliness&mdash;that makes the guileless comedy mingling with the
tragedies of a poor child&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; He knows thus much&mdash;that
life is troubled around him and that the fates are strong.&nbsp; He
implicitly confesses &ldquo;the strong hours&rdquo; of antique song.&nbsp;
This same boy&mdash;the tempestuous child of passion and revolt&mdash;went
out with quiet cheerfulness for a walk lately, saying as his cap was
put on, &ldquo;Now, mother, you are going to have a little peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This way of accepting his own conditions is shared by a sister, a very
little older, who, being of an equal and gentle temper, indisposed to
violence of every kind and tender to all without disquiet, observes
the boy&rsquo;s brief frenzies as a citizen observes the climate.&nbsp;
She knows the signs quite well and can at any time give the explanation
of some particular outburst, but without any attempt to go in search
of further or more original causes.&nbsp; Still less is she moved by
the virtuous indignation that is the least charming of the ways of some
little girls.&nbsp; <i>Elle</i> <i>ne</i> <i>fait</i> <i>que</i> <i>constater</i>.&nbsp;
Her equanimity has never been overset by the wildest of his moments,
and she has witnessed them all.&nbsp; It is needless to say that she
is not frightened by his drama, for Nature takes care that her young
creatures shall not be injured by sympathies.&nbsp; Nature encloses
them in the innocent indifference that preserves their brains from the
more harassing kinds of distress.</p>
<p>Even the very frenzy of rage does not long dim or depress the boy.&nbsp;
It is his repentance that makes him pale, and Nature here has been rather
forced, perhaps&mdash;with no very good result.&nbsp; Often must a mother
wish that she might for a few years govern her child (as far as he is
governable) by the lowest motives&mdash;trivial punishments and paltry
rewards&mdash;rather than by any kind of appeal to his sensibilities.&nbsp;
She would wish to keep the words &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;
away from his childish ears, but in this she is not seconded by her
lieutenants.&nbsp; The child himself is quite willing to close with
her plans, in so far as he is able, and is reasonably interested in
the results of her experiments.&nbsp; He wishes her attempts in his
regard to have a fair chance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope I&rsquo;ll
be good all to-morrow,&rdquo; he says with the peculiar cheerfulness
of his ordinary voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do hope so, old man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll get my penny.&nbsp; Mother, I was only naughty
once yesterday; if I have only one naughtiness to-morrow, will you give
me a halfpenny?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No reward except for real goodness
all day long.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is only too probable that this system (adopted only after the
failure of other ways of reform) will be greatly disapproved as one
of bribery.&nbsp; It may, however, be curiously inquired whether all
kinds of reward might not equally be burlesqued by that word, and whether
any government, spiritual or civil, has ever even professed to deny
rewards.&nbsp; Moreover, those who would not give a child a penny for
being good will not hesitate to fine him a penny for being naughty,
and rewards and punishments must stand or fall together.&nbsp; The more
logical objection will be that goodness is ideally the normal condition,
and that it should have, therefore, no explicit extraordinary result,
whereas naughtiness, being abnormal, should have a visible and unusual
sequel.&nbsp; To this the rewarding mother may reply that it is not
reasonable to take &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; in a little child of strong
passions as the normal condition.&nbsp; The natural thing for him is
to give full sway to impulses that are so violent as to overbear his
powers.</p>
<p>But, after all, the controversy returns to the point of practice.&nbsp;
What is the thought, or threat, or promise that will stimulate the weak
will of the child, in the moment of rage and anger, to make a sufficient
resistance?&nbsp; If the will were naturally as well developed as the
passions, the stand would be soon made and soon successful; but as it
is there must needs be a bracing by the suggestion of joy or fear.&nbsp;
Let, then, the stimulus be of a mild and strong kind at once, and mingled
with the thought of distant pleasure.&nbsp; To meet the suffering of
rage and frenzy by the suffering of fear is assuredly to make of the
little unquiet mind a battle-place of feelings too hurtfully tragic.&nbsp;
The penny is mild and strong at once, with its still distant but certain
joys of purchase; the promise and hope break the mood of misery, and
the will takes heart to resist and conquer.</p>
<p>It is only in the lesser naughtiness that he is master of himself.&nbsp;
The lesser the evil fit the more deliberate.&nbsp; So that his mother,
knowing herself to be not greatly feared, once tried to mimic the father&rsquo;s
voice with a menacing, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that noise?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The child was persistently crying and roaring on an upper floor, in
contumacy against his French nurse, when the baritone and threatening
question was sent pealing up the stairs.&nbsp; The child was heard to
pause and listen and then to say to his nurse, &ldquo;Ce n&rsquo;est
pas Monsieur; c&rsquo;est Madame,&rdquo; and then, without further loss
of time, to resume the interrupted clamours.</p>
<p>Obviously, with a little creature of six years, there are two things
mainly to be done&mdash;to keep the delicate brain from the evil of
the present excitement, especially the excitement of painful feeling,
and to break the habit of passion.&nbsp; Now that we know how certainly
the special cells of the brain which are locally affected by pain and
anger become hypertrophied by so much use, and all too ready for use
in the future at the slightest stimulus, we can no longer slight the
importance of habit.&nbsp; Any means, then, that can succeed in separating
a little child from the habit of anger does fruitful work for him in
the helpless time of his childhood.&nbsp; The work is not easy, but
a little thought should make it easy for the elders to avoid the provocation
which they&mdash;who should ward off provocations&mdash;are apt to bring
about by sheer carelessness.&nbsp; It is only in childhood that our
race knows such physical abandonment to sorrow and tears, as a child&rsquo;s
despair; and the theatre with us must needs copy childhood if it would
catch the note and action of a creature without hope.</p>
<h2>THE CHILD OF SUBSIDING TUMULT</h2>
<p>There is a certain year that is winged, as it were, against the flight
of time; it does so move, and yet withstands time&rsquo;s movement.&nbsp;
It is full of pauses that are due to the energy of change, has bounds
and rebounds, and when it is most active then it is longest.&nbsp; It
is not long with languor.&nbsp; It has room for remoteness, and leisure
for oblivion.&nbsp; It takes great excursions against time, and travels
so as to enlarge its hours.&nbsp; This certain year is any one of the
early years of fully conscious life, and therefore it is of all the
dates.&nbsp; The child of Tumult has been living amply and changefully
through such a year&mdash;his eighth.&nbsp; It is difficult to believe
that his is a year of the self-same date as that of the adult, the men
who do not breast their days.</p>
<p>For them is the inelastic, or but slightly elastic, movement of things.&nbsp;
Month matched with month shows a fairly equal length.&nbsp; Men and
women never travel far from yesterday; nor is their morrow in a distant
light.&nbsp; There is recognition and familiarity between their seasons.&nbsp;
But the Child of Tumult has infinite prospects in his year.&nbsp; Forgetfulness
and surprise set his east and his west at immeasurable distance.&nbsp;
His Lethe runs in the cheerful sun.&nbsp; You look on your own little
adult year, and in imagination enlarge it, because you know it to be
the contemporary of his.&nbsp; Even she who is quite old, if she have
a vital fancy, may face a strange and great extent of a few years of
her life still to come&mdash;his years, the years she is to live at
his side.</p>
<p>Reason seems to be making good her rule in this little boy&rsquo;s
life, not so much by slow degrees as by sudden and fitful accessions.&nbsp;
His speech is yet so childish that he chooses, for a toy, with blushes
of pleasure, &ldquo;a little duck what can walk&rdquo;; but with a beautifully
clear accent he greets his mother with the colloquial question, &ldquo;Well,
darling, do you know the latest?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>what</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The latest: do you know the latest?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he
tells his news, generally, it must be owned, with some reference to
his own wrongs.&nbsp; On another occasion the unexpected little phrase
was varied; the news of the war then raging distressed him; a thousand
of the side he favoured had fallen.&nbsp; The child then came to his
mother&rsquo;s room with the question: &ldquo;Have you heard the saddest?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Moreover the &ldquo;saddest&rdquo; caused him several fits of perfectly
silent tears, which seized him during the day, on his walks or at other
moments of recollection.&nbsp; From such great causes arise such little
things!&nbsp; Some of his grief was for the nation he admired, and some
was for the triumph of his brother, whose sympathies were on the other
side, and who perhaps did not spare his sensibilities.</p>
<p>The tumults of a little child&rsquo;s passions of anger and grief,
growing fewer as he grows older, rather increase than lessen in their
painfulness.&nbsp; There is a fuller consciousness of complete capitulation
of all the childish powers to the overwhelming compulsion of anger.&nbsp;
This is not temptation; the word is too weak for the assault of a child&rsquo;s
passion upon his will.&nbsp; That little will is taken captive entirely,
and before the child was seven he knew that it was so.&nbsp; Such a
consciousness leaves all babyhood behind and condemns the child to suffer.&nbsp;
For a certain passage of his life he is neither unconscious of evil,
as he was, nor strong enough to resist it, as he will be.&nbsp; The
time of the subsiding of the tumult is by no means the least pitiable
of the phases of human life.&nbsp; Happily the recovery from each trouble
is ready and sure; so that the child who had been abandoned to naughtiness
with all his will in an entire consent to the gloomy possession of his
anger, and who had later undergone a haggard repentance, has his captivity
suddenly turned again, &ldquo;like rivers in the south.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; he had wept, in a kind of extremity of remorse;
&ldquo;forget it, darling, and don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t be sad;&rdquo;
and it is he, happily, who forgets.&nbsp; The wasted look of his pale
face is effaced by the touch of a single cheerful thought, and five
short minutes can restore the ruin, as though a broken little German
town should in the twinkling of an eye be restored as no architect could
restore it&mdash;should be made fresh, strong, and tight again, looking
like a full box of toys, as a town was wont to look in the new days
of old.</p>
<p>When his ruthless angers are not in possession the child shows the
growth of this tardy reason that&mdash;quickened&mdash;is hereafter
to do so much for his peace and dignity, by the sweetest consideration.&nbsp;
Denied a second handful of strawberries, and seeing quite clearly that
the denial was enforced reluctantly, he makes haste to reply, &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t matter, darling.&rdquo;&nbsp; At any sudden noise in the
house his beautiful voice, with all its little difficulties of pronunciation,
is heard with the sedulous reassurance: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,
mother, nobody hurted ourselves!&rdquo;&nbsp; He is not surprised so
as to forget this gentle little duty, which was never required of him,
but is of his own devising.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of his dear and admired American friend,
he says all these things, good and evil, with an English accent; and
at the American play his English accent was irrepressible.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too comic; no, it&rsquo;s too comic,&rdquo; he called in his enjoyment;
being the only perfectly fearless child in the world, he will not consent
to the conventional shyness in public, whether he be the member of an
audience or of a congregation, but makes himself perceptible.&nbsp;
And even when he has a desperate thing to say, in the moment of absolute
revolt&mdash;such a thing as &ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> like you, mother,&rdquo;
which anon he will recant with convulsions of distress&mdash;he has
to &ldquo;speak the thing he will,&rdquo; and when he recants it is
not for fear.</p>
<p>If such a child could be ruled (or approximately ruled, for inquisitorial
government could hardly be so much as attempted) by some small means
adapted to his size and to his physical aspect, it would be well for
his health, but that seems at times impossible.&nbsp; By no effort can
his elders altogether succeed in keeping tragedy out of the life that
is so unready for it.&nbsp; Against great emotions no one can defend
him by any forethought.&nbsp; He is their subject; and to see him thus
devoted and thus wrung, thus wrecked by tempests inwardly, so that you
feel grief has him actually by the heart, recalls the reluctance&mdash;the
question&mdash;wherewith you perceive the interior grief of poetry or
of a devout life.&nbsp; Cannot the Muse, cannot the Saint, you ask,
live with something less than this?&nbsp; If this is the truer life,
it seems hardly supportable.&nbsp; In like manner it should be possible
for a child of seven to come through his childhood with griefs that
should not so closely involve him, but should deal with the easier sentiments.</p>
<p>Despite all his simplicity, the child has (by way of inheritance,
for he has never heard them) the self-excusing fictions of our race.&nbsp;
Accused of certain acts of violence, and unable to rebut the charge
with any effect, he flies to the old convention: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know what I was doing,&rdquo; he avers, using a great deal of gesticulation
to express the temporary distraction of his mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Darling,
after nurse slapped me as hard as she could, I didn&rsquo;t know what
I was doing, so I suppose I pushed her with my foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
mother knows as well as does Tolstoi that men and children know what
they are doing, and are the more intently aware as the stress of feeling
makes the moments more tense; and she will not admit a plea which her
child might have learned from the undramatic authors he has never read.</p>
<p>Far from repenting of her old system of rewards, and far from taking
fright at the name of a bribe, the mother of the Child of Tumult has
only to wish she had at command rewards ample and varied enough to give
the shock of hope and promise to the heart of the little boy, and change
his passion at its height.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
